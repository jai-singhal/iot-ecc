            "message": "ons , another new position . \nHe remains an executive vice president , the company said , and his new position reflects `` the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman 's high performance plastic materials . '' \nGordon Trimmer will succeed Mr. Haines as manager of Canadian operations , and Mr. Kushkin 's former position is n't being filled at this time , the company said . \nGeneral Electric Co. said it signed a contract with the developers of the Ocean State Power project for the second phase of an independent $ 400 million power plant , which is being built in Burrillville , R.I . \nGE , along with a division of Ebasco , a subsidiary of Enserch Corp. , have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project , which they expect to complete in late 1990 . \nThe second portion will be completed the following year . \nGE 's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion . \nThe Environmental Protection Agency is getting a lot out of the Superfund program . \nOf the $ 4.4 billion spent so far on the program , 60 % is going for administrative costs , management and research , the Office of Technology Assessment just reported . \nOnly 36 of 1,200 priority cleanup sites have been `` decontaminated . '' \nOver the next 50 years , $ 500 billion is earmarked for the program . \nAt current allocations , that means EPA will be spending $ 300 billion on itself . \nIt may not be toxic , but we know where one waste dump is . \nChambers Development Co. said its Security Bureau Inc. unit purchased two security concerns in Florida that will add $ 2.1 million of annual revenue . \nPurchase of the businesses serving Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach , Fla. , is part of a plan by Chambers to expand in the growing security industry . \nTerms were n't disclosed . \nBasf AG said it moved its headquarters for Latin America to Mexico and the headquarters for the Asia\\/Australia regional division to Singapore , effective Oct . \nThe central offices for both regions were previously located in Ludwigshafen , Basf headquarters . \nThe West German chemical concern called the moves a further step in the internationalization of its business activities . \nBoth regions are the fastest-growing areas for Basf , the company said . \nDavid H. Eisenberg , 53 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Imasco 's 500-store Peoples Drug Stores Inc. unit , based in Alexandria , Va . \nMr. Eisenberg was senior executive vice president and chief operating officer . \nImasco is a tobacco , retailing , restaurant and financial services concern . \nLotus Development Corp. is in talks to sell its Signal stock-quote service to Infotechnology Inc. , the New York parent of Financial News Network , people familiar with the negotiations said . \nThey said the price would be around $ 10 million . \nSignal , which has an estimated 10,000 subscribers and is profitable , provides stock quotes over an FM radio band that can be received by specially equipped personal computers . \nThe computers will display stock prices selected by users . \nLotus , Cambridge , Mass. , has been rumored to have the sale of the four-year-old unit under consideration for a year . \nThe business is n't related to Lotus 's main businesses of making computer software and publishing information on compact disks . \n`` Please submit your offers , '' says Felipe Bince Jr . \nHe surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill . \nThe agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $ 80 million . \nNot a peso is offered . \nMr. Bince , the trust 's associate executive trustee , declares the bidding a failure . \n`` It 's getting harder to sell , '' he mutters as he leaves the room . \nIndeed . Recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant . \nOf the four , only the bank and the plant drew bids -- one apiece . \nIn October 1987 , President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos . \nTwo years later , Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled . \nOctober is a critical month for the privatization program . \nManila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged . \nIn addition , the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines , the national carrier , an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls `` the bellwether of privatization . '' \nAll told , there are assets on the line valued at up to $ 1.03 billion . \nThe privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds . \nMuch of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program . \nBut efforts have been thwarted by official indifference , bureaucratic resistance , a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace , political opposition and government misjudgments . \nMost recently , a lack of buyers has been added to the list . \nRather than gathering momentum , the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets . \nThe axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset , the harder the privatization process . \n`` You just do n't see a whole lot happening , '' says an international economist . \nTo be sure , the program has n't completely stalled . \nThe Asset Privatization Trust , the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties , has recorded sales of more than $ 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 . \nBut its success has been largely in the sale of small , nonperforming companies , which are valued for their assets . \nDealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again . \nRamon Garcia , the Asset Trust 's executive trustee , admits to what he calls `` temporary setbacks . '' \nIn light of the poor results recently , he says , the agency is adopting an `` attitude of flexibility . '' \nOctober 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank , Associated Bank , for the minimum price of 671 million pesos -LRB- $ 31 million -RRB- . \nAt the end of the month , the agency again will offer the bank . \nBut instead of a minimum price , only a target price will be established . \nBankers say , however , that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price . \nThe bank has a negative net worth , they say . \nIn addition , special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner , Leonardo Ty , the right to match the highest bid . \nMr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution . \nIn 1983 , the loans were converted into equity , giving Manila 98 % of the bank , but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights . \nHis ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers . \nSeparately , the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines , or Picop , as the paper mill is known . \nThe price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market . \nBut according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill , price is n't the only consideration . \nAs it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold . \n-LRB- About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . -RRB- \nPotential buyers , mostly foreign companies , are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that , by the government 's own reckoning , needs some $ 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation . \nThe prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the Elders group of Australia , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say . \nMr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer . \nUnder government regulations , however , foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % . \nEven though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop , critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners . \nA series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale . \nMr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . \nThe question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . \nThe carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed . \nThis maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors , increasing board membership to nine . \nThe new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger , president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc. , and Peter S. Willmott , chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc . \nGerard E. Wood , 51 years old , was elected president , chief executive officer and a director of this minerals and materials company . \nHe succeeds Harry A. Durney , 65 , who is retiring from active duty but remains a director and consultant . \nMr. Wood has been president and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc . \nEagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. , two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies , agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction . \nThe new holding company , Webster\\/Eagle Bancorp Inc. , will have about $ 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut . \nTangible capital will be about $ 115 million . \nThe merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement . \nIn the merger , each share of Webster , based in Waterbury , will be converted into one share of the new company . \nEach share of Eagle , based in Bristol , will become 0.95 share of Webster\\/Eagle . \nIn American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to $ 11 . \nIn national over-the-counter trading , Webster shares fell 25 cents to $ 12.375 . \nWebster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million . \nTheir indicated market values thus are about $ 43.3 million and $ 28.6 million , respectively . \nFrank J. Pascale , chairman of Eagle , will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith , president and chief executive officer of Webster , will take those posts at Webster\\/Eagle . \nHarold W. Smith Sr. , chairman of Webster , will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company . \nRalph T. Linsley , vice chairman of Eagle , will become vice chairman of Webster\\/Eagle . \nThe board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company . \nIn an interview , James Smith said the banks ' `` markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative . '' \nNonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5 % of the combined banks ' total loans outstanding , he said . \nAt June 30 , Webster , which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury , had assets of $ 699 million . \nEagle , which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington , had assets of $ 469.6 million on that date . \nGuillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , `` Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well . \nThe Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries . \nHaving said that , we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case . \nIt is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims . \nIn the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline . \nHow can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the state is so heavily represented in it ? \n-LRB- True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . -RRB- \nRegrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 -LCB- state enterprises -RCB- currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 . \n'' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure . \nI refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint . \nThose enterprises , however , are not going to be privatized . \nThey are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution . \nIn language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy ... . '' \nYet clearly , modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the `` privatization bug . '' \nThe bottom line , however , is not economic but political reform . \nA long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to , without having to answer to the public . \nTo guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability . \nDaniel James President Mexico-United States Institute \nThe board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . \nThe third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it reports operating results this week . \nPonce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 . \nA labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands , according to people familiar with the group . \nThe group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . \nBut to avoid the risk of rejection , the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today . \nInstead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction . \nPeople familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , British Airways PLC , dropped out . \nIn composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , UAL closed at $ 168.50 a share , down $ 21.625 . \nBut the pilots union , which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 , appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air . \nAlthough the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks , it believes bank financing could be obtained . \nAfter the collapse of the last effort , the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed . \nUnder the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders . \nThose current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company . \nFor example , the group could offer $ 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at $ 30 a share . \nUAL currently has 22.6 million shares , fully diluted . \nThe new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest . \nThe difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control . \nThe failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % . \nIt was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % . \nManagement 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air . \nOne option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period . \nAlthough the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time . \nThe board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale . \nThe labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board . \nHowever , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse . \nThree top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp . \nMr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid . \nBut Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . \nOn Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future . '' \nHowever , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . \nAlso late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer . \nBut the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor . \nOne advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid . \nSpeculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing , chief financial officer John Pope , may come under pressure to resign . \nHowever , people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time . \nDespite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing , UAL remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison . \nWhittle Communications Limited Partnership , Knoxville , Tenn. , will launch its first media property targeting Hispanic women . \n`` La Familia de Hoy , '' or `` Today 's Family , '' will debut this spring and will combine a national bimonthly magazine and TV programming . \nThe television element of `` La Familia '' includes a series of two-minute informational features to air seven days a week on the Spanish-language Univision network , a unit of Univision Holdings Inc. , which is 80%-owned by Hallmark Cards Inc . \nThe features will focus on `` parenting , family health and nutrition , and financial management , '' and will carry 30 seconds of advertising . \nThe magazines , also ad-supported , will be distributed in more than 10,000 doctors ' offices , clinics , and health centers in Hispanic and largely Hispanic communities . \nWEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $ 300 million sale of 10-year notes , the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp . \nThe 10 7\\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said . \nWeirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , said $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel . \nRemaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's capital spending program . \nLep Group PLC of Britain , which holds a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company . \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own . \nIt noted , however , that it has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction . \nLep Group and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 Profit Systems common shares , or 62.42 % , the filing said . \nProfit Systems , Valley Stream , N.Y. , is an air freight forwarding concern . \nU.S. official reserve assets rose $ 6.05 billion in September , to $ 68.42 billion , the Treasury Department said . \nThe gain compared with a $ 1.10 billion decline in reserve assets in August to $ 62.36 billion , the department said . \nU.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies , gold , special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the IMF . \nThe nation 's holdings of foreign currencies increased $ 5.67 billion in September to $ 39.08 billion , while its gold reserves were virtually unchanged at $ 11.07 billion . \nU.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month rose $ 247 million , to $ 9.49 billion , and its reserve position at the IMF increased $ 142 million , to $ 8.79 billion . \nAlusuisse of America Inc. plans to sell its Consolidated Aluminum Corp. subsidiary as part of its strategy to focus more on aluminum packaging in the U.S. . \nAlusuisse , of New York , declined to say how much it expects to get for the unit ; the company has hired First Boston Corp. to help identify bidders . \nAlusuisse is a subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd. , a Zurich , Switzerland , producer of aluminum , chemicals and packaging products . \nConsolidated , which had 1988 revenue of $ 400 million , makes aluminum sheet and foil products at its Hannibal , Ohio , and Jackson , Tenn. , rolling mills and recycles aluminum at a plant in Bens Run , W.Va . \nManhattan National Corp. said Michael A. Conway , president and chief executive officer , was elected chief executive of the holding company 's two principal insurance subsidiaries . \nHe succeeds Paul P. Aniskovich Jr. , who resigned to pursue other business interests , the company said . \nMr. Conway , 42 years old , was elected chairman , president and chief executive of Manhattan Life Insurance Co. and president and chief executive of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co . \nHarry Rossi , 69 , chairman of the holding company , also remains chairman of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co . \nMr. Conway was executive vice president and chief investment officer of Union Central Life Insurance Co. , of Cincinnati , in 1987 , when Union Central bought a 54 % interest in Manhattan National Corp . \nHe resigned as an officer of Central Life to accept the Manhattan National presidency . \nDaniel J. Terra , a director of First Illinois Corp. , said that in August he reduced his stake in First Illinois to 26.48 % of the common shares outstanding . \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Terra said he sold 263,684 First Illinois common shares from Aug. 9 to Aug. 28 for $ 9.9375 to $ 10.5625 a share . \nAs a result of the sales he holds 6,727,042 shares . \nMr. Terra said in the filing that he sold the stock to decrease his position in the Evanston , Ill. , banking concern . \nHe may sell more shares in the open market or in private transactions , but would n't rule out changing his intentions and buying shares , the filing said . \nSciMed Life Systems Inc. , Minneapolis , said a federal appeals court vacated an earlier summary judgment in its favor . \nA lower court in St. Paul had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter SciMed manufactures does n't infringe on a patent owned by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems , a unit of Eli Lilly & Co . \nSciMed said the appeals court remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings . \nIn national over-the-counter trading Friday , SciMed shares tumbled $ 2.75 to $ 43 . \nSciMed said it `` remains committed '' both to the `` vigorous defense '' of its position that the catheter does n't infringe the Lilly unit 's patent , and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims , which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts . \nA REVISED BID FOR UAL is being prepared by a labor-management group , sources said . \nThe new proposal , which would transfer majority ownership of United Air 's parent to employees and leave some stock in public hands , would be valued at $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or as much as $ 5.42 billion . \nBut UAL 's board is n't expected to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share bid that collapsed recently . \nTakeover stock speculators have incurred paper losses of over $ 700 million from the failed UAL offer , their worst loss ever on a single deal . \nFord and Saab ended talks about a possible alliance after Ford concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return . \nThe collapse Friday prompted speculation that Ford would intensify its pursuit of Jaguar , which is negotiating a defensive alliance with GM . \nStock prices edged up in quiet trading Friday . \nThe Dow Jones industrials rose 5.94 , to 2689.14 , making the gain for the week a record 119.88 points , or 4.7 % . \nMost bond prices fell , but junk bonds and the dollar rose . \nNew York City bonds were sold off by many investors last week amid political and economic uncertainty . \nMore banks are being hurt by Arizona 's worsening real-estate slump . \nFirst Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles said Friday it expects a $ 16 million quarterly loss , citing property-loan losses at its Arizona unit . \nOPEC 's ability to produce more oil than it can sell is starting to cast a shadow over world oil markets . \nOPEC officials worry that prices could collapse a few months from now if the group does n't adopt new quotas . \nSaatchi & Saatchi has attracted offers for some of its advertising units but has rejected them , sources said . \nThe proposals , from suitors including Interpublic Group , come as the London-based ad giant struggles through its most difficult period ever . \nQintex Australia suffered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate filed for Chapter 11 protection . \nQintex 's $ 1.5 billion pact to buy MGM\\/UA collapsed recently . \nKodak entered the high-definition television market by unveiling a device that can convert conventional film into high-definition video . \nA handful of small U.S. firms are refusing to cede the HDTV-screen market to Japanese manufacturers . \nFreight rates are bottoming out and starting to rebound . \nTrucking , shipping and air-freight firms are all planning rate increases , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand . \nTexaco has purchased an oil-producing company in Texas for $ 476.5 million . \nIt is Texaco 's first major acquisition since the legal battle with Pennzoil began over four years ago . \nWinnebago posted a widened quarterly loss and slashed its dividend in half , reflecting the deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle sales . \nMarkets -- \nStocks : \nVolume 164,830,000 shares . \nDow Jones industrials 2689.14 , up 5.94 ;

Eldred , president and chief executive officer . \n`` All our efforts are now focused on improving earnings to the point where we can fund additional new-country development , continue to invest in the business and reinstate the dividend , '' he added . \nThe company offers more than 3,500 parts and supplies directly to microcomputer and minicomputer users through catalog sales . \nThe Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville , N.Y . \nQuantum stopped shipping the drugs last month , following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals . \nThe FDA requested the recall of Quantum 's mioxidil tablets , chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because , it said , the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was . \nAmerican Home Products , based in New York , agreed to recall four other products , trazadone , doxepin , diazepam and lorazapam , because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA . \nNo safety problems with the products are known , the FDA said . \nAn FDA spokesperson said the drugs are still available under other brand names . \nLast month , American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit . \nIt also temporarily closed Quantum , because of the internal investigation , as well as the FDA 's ongoing inquiry . \nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading , American Home Products rose 75 cents to $ 105 on Friday . \nLyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54 % , to $ 73 million , or 91 cents a share , from $ 160 million a year earlier . \nYear-earlier per-share results are n't applicable because the company went public in January . \nRevenue rose 7.7 % to $ 1.28 billion from $ 1.18 billion . \nThe petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant . \nLike other refiners , Lyondell 's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower . \nWhile the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter , costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete . \nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Lyondell was unchanged at $ 18.50 a share . \nFour former Cordis Corp. officials were acquitted of federal charges related to the Miami-based company 's sale of pacemakers , including conspiracy to hide pacemaker defects . \nJurors in U.S. District Court in Miami cleared Harold Hershhenson , a former executive vice president ; John Pagones , a former vice president ; and Stephen Vadas and Dean Ciporkin , who had been engineers with Cordis . \nEarlier this year , Cordis , a maker of medical devices , agreed to plead guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges related to the pacemakers and to pay the government about $ 5.7 million in fines and other costs . \nCordis sold its pacemaker operations two years ago to Telectronics Holding Ltd. of Australia . \nPAPERS : \nManagement and unions representing 2,400 employees at Torstar Corp. 's Toronto Star reached a tentative contract agreement Friday , averting a strike by most employees of Canada 's largest daily newspaper . \nMembers of the largest union , representing 1,700 workers , voted in favor of the pact yesterday . \nFour other unions have yet to vote , but their leadership also recommended approval . \nThe pact proposes a 2 1\\/2-year contract with a raise of 8 % in the first year , 7 % in the second and 4 % for the final six months . \nAmgen Inc. said its second-quarter earnings increased more than tenfold to $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , due to increased sales of the company 's new antianemia drug for kidney patients . \nThe Thousand Oaks , Calif.-based biotechnology company reported a 97 % increase in revenue to $ 42.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30 . \nIn the year-ago period , Amgen reported net income of $ 320,000 , or two cents a share , on revenue of $ 21.5 million . \nFor the six months , the company reported a more than sixfold increase in earnings to $ 4.7 million , or 26 cents a share , from $ 625,000 , or four cents a share a year ago . \nRevenue rose 77 % to $ 72.6 million , from last year 's $ 41 million . \nLEBANESE LAWMAKERS APPROVED a peace plan but Aoun rejected it . \nLebanon 's Parliament passed the power-sharing accord to end the country 's 14-year-old conflict , but the Christian military leader wad the plan was `` full of ambiguities . '' \nThe Arab League-sponsored pact , drafted during three weeks of talks at the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif , includes Syrian proposals for at least a partial troop pullout from Lebanon , and guarantees an equal number of seats for Moslems and Christians in the Parliament . \nThe rejection by Aoun , who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus 's 33,000 troops , puts the future of the agreement in doubt . \nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA BRACED for earthquake-related traffic jams . \nAs rescuers pressed their efforts after finding a survivor in a collapsed freeway , the San Francisco Bay area girded for hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking to avoid routes ravaged by last Tuesday 's tremor . \nIn Oakland , officials said the 57-year-old longshoreman who spent four days entombed in rubble was in critical condition with slight improvement . \nEstimates of damage in the area , visited Friday by Bush , topped $ 5 billion . \nThe baseball commissioner announced that the third game of the World Series between the Giants and the Athletics would n't resume until Friday . \nTHE U.S. . IS REQUIRED to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plans . \nUnder guidelines included in an exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence panel last year , the U.S. must inform foreign dictators of plans likely to endanger their lives . \nThe existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week , citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions , officials said . \nBush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said . \nThe shuttle Atlantis 's crew prepared to return to Earth today several hours earlier than planned to avoid high winds forecast at the landing site at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif . \nThe five astronauts , who stowed gear and tested the spacecraft 's steering , said they were unconcerned about the touchy weather expected in the Mojave Desert . \nCommonwealth leaders issued a declaration giving South Africa six months to deliver on pledges to ease apartheid or face new reprisals . \nThe 49-nation organization , meeting in Malaysia , called for tighter financial pressure immediately . \nBritain 's Prime Minister Thatcher alone dissented . \nEast Germany 's leadership vowed swift action to ease travel to the West . \nDespite the pledge by the Communist rulers , tens of thousands of people across the country staged marches over the weekend to demand democratic freedoms . \nIn Leipzig , more than 500 people met with local party officials to discuss internal changes . \nThe Senate convicted federal Judge Alcee Hastings of Miami of eight impeachment articles , removing him from the bench . \nThe chamber voted 69-26 Friday to convict the judge of perjury and bribery conspiracy . \nIt marked the first time a U.S. official was impeached on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . \nRep. Garcia and his wife were found guilty by a federal jury in New York of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech Corp. in return for official acts by the New York Democrat . \nThe jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 interest-free loan from an officer of the defunct defense contractor . \nAuthorities in Honduras launched an investigation into the cause of Saturday 's crash of a Honduran jetliner that killed 132 of the 146 people aboard . \nThe Boeing 727 , en route to Honduras from Costa Rica via Nicaragua , smashed into the hills outside Tegucigalpa as it approached the capital 's airport in high winds and low clouds . \nThe U.S. and Israel have been holding what an aide to Prime Minister Shamir called intense telephone negotiations in an effort to bridge differences over Mideast peace moves . \nThe Labor Party , meanwhile , threatened to support a parliamentary motion to topple the coalition unless Shamir showed flexibility on Arab-Israeli talks . \nNicaragua 's Defense Ministry said a group of Contra rebels ambushed two trucks carrying troops in northern Nicaragua , killing 18 of the soldiers . \nThe incident occurred Saturday night . \nThe Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed insurgents agreed in March to suspend offensive operations , but there has been sporadic fighting . \nScientists have isolated a molecule that may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma , Immunex Corp. said . \nThe molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor , which directs the growth and function of white blood cells . \nDied : Alfred Hayes , 79 , former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Saturday , in New Canaan , Conn . \nContel Corp. said third-quarter net income increased 16 % to $ 72 million , or 45 cents a share , from $ 62 million , or 39 cents a share , as a result of strong growth in telephone-access lines and long-distance minutes of use . \nThe telecommunications company 's results included a one-time gain of $ 4 million , or two cents a share , from the sale of Contel Credit , a leasing and financial-services subsidiary . \nRevenue rose 8.3 % to $ 780 million from $ 720 million . \nTelephone-operations quarterly profit increased 9 % to $ 84 million from $ 77 million , while federal-systems earnings declined 33 % to $ 4 million from $ 6 million . \nInformation systems posted a loss of $ 8 million , compared with a loss of $ 9 million a year earlier . \nCustomer-access lines increased at an annualized rate of about 4 % and minutes of long-distance use rose about 12 % . \nA 10 % gain in operating profit in the quarter was offset by a 21 % boost in interest expense , reflecting higher consolidated borrowings and interest rates . \nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Contel closed at $ 33.75 a share , down .50 cents . \nIn East Germany , where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism , they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz . \nMr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him . \n`` You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes , '' says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends . \n`` With Krenz , we just do n't know what to expect . '' \nMr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker . \nBut he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either . \nAccording to East Germany 's ADN news agency , Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies . \nAlready last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media . \nOn Thursday , a day after he took office , East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer . \nThe regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost . \n`` It was quite a shock , '' says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper . \n`` For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television . '' \nOther changes , including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans , are expected . \nBut whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans , who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz . \nAnd that 's a problem . \nMr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . \n`` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . \n`` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' \nAlthough Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . \nUnlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . \nIndeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . \nHe was later shown on television , fielding questions . \nAt one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies . \nThe worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . \nPeople have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . '' \nThe exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies . \nThis same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring . \nRather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . '' \nRep. Ronnie Flippo -LRB- D. , Ala. -RRB- , one of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change . \n`` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . \nBut there 's another side to Mr. Krenz . \nBorn in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus . \nHe moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , Mr. Honecker , and emerged as the heir apparent . \nBarbara Donovan , an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich , says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image , but she doubts he 's a true reformer . \nEven if he is , she adds , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo . \nAgainst this background , the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing . \nThe sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 . \n`` He does n't have any honeymoon period , '' says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin . \n`` But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . '' \nThe diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him . \nThe East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations . \nAnd his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man . \nFor average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle . \n`` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' says a 30-year-old East German doctor . \n`` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . '' \nThe doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning . \nThe walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition . \n`` I have to come here to read the walls , '' says the doctor , `` because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers . '' \nMeanwhile , East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor . \nTelevision last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production . \nEast Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason to change your own . \nHis point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes . \n`` It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny , '' says the East Berlin shopkeeper , `` But everyone I know laughed about it . \nThe list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing . \nBut the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms . \nNew experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures . \nThe latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society , the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments . \nThe meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research . \nOf the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end . \nThis was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May , at the height of the controversy , when more than 1,500 scientists , along with scores of reporters and TV crews , crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject . \nNeither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar , Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons , were at the meeting . \nBut some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience . \nThe committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research . \nMost of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons . \nThe experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium . \nWhen an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break u",

'' \nRobert Delaney , a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions . \nNow we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor . \nYou 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . '' \nNot everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers . \n`` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \nLess-than-truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a 4.7 % rate incr",

'' \nAnalysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary . \nAnd , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow . \nSterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson 's promise Friday . \nIn European trading it declined to $ 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from $ 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late Thursday . \nEconomists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks , the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % , both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged . \nFriday 's Market Activity \nThe dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated . \nForeign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points . \nCurrency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve . \nLate in the New York trading day , the dollar was quoted at 1.8578 marks , up from 1.8470 marks late Thursday in New York . \nThe U.S. currency was also changing hands at 142.43 yen , up from 141.70 yen in New York late Thursday . \nIn Tokyo on Monday , the U.S. currency opened for trading at 141.95 yen , up from Friday 's Tokyo close of 141.35 yen . \nOn the Commodity Exchange in New York , gold for current delivery settled at $ 367.30 an ounce , up 20 cents . \nEstimated volume was a light 2.4 million ounces . \nIn early trading in Hong Kong Monday , gold was quoted at $ 366.50 an ounce . \nEast Rock Partners Limited Partnership said it proposed to acquire A.P. Green Industries Inc. for $ 40 a share . \nIn an Oct. 19 letter to A.P. Green 's board , East Rock said the offer is subject to the signing of a merger agreement by no later than Oct. 31 . \nThe letter , attached to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , said the approval is also contingent upon obtaining satisfactory financing . \nAn A.P. Green official declined to comment on the filing . \nThe $ 40-a-share proposal values the company at about $ 106.6 million . \nA.P. Green currently has 2,664,098 shares outstanding . \nIts stock closed at $ 38 , up $ 1.875 , in national over-the-counter trading . \nThe company is a Mexico , Mo. , maker of refractory products . \nEast Rock also said in the filing that it boosted its stake in A.P. Green to 8.7 % . \nIt now holds 233,000 A.P. Green common shares , including 30,000 shares bought last Thursday for $ 35.50 to $ 36.50 a share . \nNew York-based John Kuhns and Robert MacDonald control East Rock Partners Inc. , the sole general partner of East Rock Partners L.P . \nThe sole limited partner of the partnership is Westwood Brick Lime Inc. , an indirect subsidiary of Westwood Group Inc . \nBoth Westwood Brick and Westwood Group are based in Boston . \nFreight rates , declining for most of the decade because of competition spurred by deregulation , are bottoming out , turning upward and threatening to fuel inflation . \nTrucking , shipping and air-freight companies have announced rate increases , scheduled for this fall or early next year , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand for freight transport . \nMajor shippers say they expect freight rates to rise at least as fast as inflation and maybe faster in the next few years . \nThat 's a big change from recent years when freight haulage was a bright spot for U.S. productivity , helping to restrain inflation and make U.S. industry more competitive abroad . \n`` Demand has caught up with the supply of certain types of freight transportation , and rates are starting to move up '' at a rate `` close to or slightly more than the inflation rate , '' said Clifford Sayre , director of logistics at Du Pont Co . \nShippers surveyed recently by Ohio State University said they expect their freight-transport , storage and distribution costs to rise about 4 % this year . \nOnly 10 % of the 250 shippers polled expected their freight-transport costs to decrease , compared with 30 % who had looked to freight transport to reduce costs in past years . \n`` This is the first year since transportation deregulation in 1980 that we have had such a dramatic and broad-based upturn in perceived transportation rates , '' said Bernard LaLonde , a transportation logistics professor at Ohio State in Columbus . \nThe deregulation of railroads and trucking companies that began in 1980 enabled shippers to bargain for transportation . \nCarriers could use their equipment more efficiently , leading to overcapacity they were eager to fill . \nShippers cut about $ 35 billion from their annual , inter-city truck and rail costs , to about $ 150 billion , or about 6.4 % of gross national product , down from 8 % of GNP in 1981 . \nBut with much of the inefficiency squeezed out of the freight-transport system , rising costs are likely to be reflected directly in higher freight rates . \n`` Shippers are saying ` the party 's over , ' '' said Mr. LaLonde . \n`` Shippers wo n't be able to look for transportation-cost savings as they have for the last eight or nine years . \nTransport rates wo n't be an opportunity for offsetting cost increases in other segments of the economy . '' \nRobert Delaney , a consultant at Arthur D. Little Inc. , Cambridge , Mass. , said `` We 've gotten all the benefits of deregulation in freight-cost reductions . \nNow we are starting to see real freight-rate increases as carriers replace equipment , pay higher fuel costs and pay more for labor . \nYou 'll see carriers try to recoup some of the price cutting that occurred previously . '' \nNot everyone believes that the good times are over for shippers . \n`` There 's still a lot of pressure on rates in both rail and truck , '' said Gerard McCullough , lecturer in transportation at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . \nLess-than-truckload companies , which carry the freight of several shippers in each truck trailer , discounted away a 4.7 % rate increase implemented last April . \nThe carriers were competing fiercely for market share . \nRailroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . \nAn official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . '' \nConsolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . \nTruckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . \nAnd `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said . \nAir-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . \nAnd Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years . \nSuch rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan . \nShip companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years . \nSome bulk shipping rates have increased `` 3 % to 4 % in the past few months , '' said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd . \nAnd ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates . \nCarriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . \nShip lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April . \nMGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares . \nThe Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering . \nThe hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will lead the underwriters . \nProceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand hotel\\/casino and theme park . \nBob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination . \nMr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair ; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons . \nUnable to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a `` company court '' for a hearing . \nAt the scheduled time , Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked . \nAfter the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` Go ahead and tell us what happened . \nWe may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait until the end . '' \nNo lawyers or tape recorders were present . \nThe only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists , one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture . \nOver a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story . \nHe talked about 20 minutes . \nWhen he was through , the court members asked many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses . \nThe chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks . \nBob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real . \nIt happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles . \nThe court is called the Management Appeals Committee , or just `` MAC , '' and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year . \nAlter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis , the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis , a General Electric plant in Columbia , Md. , or a number of other companies . \nThese firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call corporate due process . \nAlthough corporate due process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry . \nIn the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it . \nCorporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons . \nIt reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations . \nIt helps to keep out unions . \nIt increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control . \nWhat must your management team do to establish corporate due process ? \nHere are four key steps : \n1 . Make sure you have a strong personnel department . \nIt must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases . \nAt Polaroid , the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year ; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages . \nAt TWA , the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists . \nAt Citicorp , the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution . \nIn a typical year , up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment . \nIn a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle . \n2 . Formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach . \nSee that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators . \nCoach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately . \nIn case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen . \nIn the 15 companies I studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % . \n3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator . \nA panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support . \nAn adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy . \nInternational Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach . \n4 . Make your due-process system visible . \nIt wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it . \nMost managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . \nOn the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . \nSmith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs . \nNaturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it . \nAt IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive . \nFederal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale , chief executive and chief operating officer , respectively , sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases . \nMr. Ewing is a consultant based in Winchester , Mass. , and author of `` Justice on the Job : Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace '' -LRB- Harvard Business

thin trading . \nAt Tokyo , the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 112.16 points to 35486.38 . \nThe index advanced 266.66 points Thursday . \nIn early trading in Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index rose 101.98 points to 35588.36 . \nFriday 's volume on the First Section was estimated at one billion shares , up from 862 million Thursday . \nWinners outpaced losers , 572 to 368 , while 181 issues remained unchanged . \nWith investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning , making traders believe the market was back to normal . \nThe Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking . \n`` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session . \nThe Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 22.78 points Thursday , was up 14.06 points , or 0.53 % , at 2679.72 . \nThe Second Section index , which rose 15.72 points Thursday , was up 11.88 points , or 0.32 % , to close at 3717.46 . \nVolume in the second section was estimated at 30 million shares , up from 28 million Thursday . \nIn turmoil caused by the previous Friday 's plunge in New York stocks , the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday . \nBut the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with Wall Street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on Oct. 13 . \nThe Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo . \nThe Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week , adding 1017.69 points in four days -- more than erasing Monday 's losses . \nBut further major advances on the Nikkei are n't foreseen this week by market observers . \nInvestors are still waiting to see how the U.S. government will decide on interest rates and how the dollar will be stabilized . \nSome high-priced issues made a comeback Friday . \nPioneer surged 450 yen -LRB- $ 3.16 -RRB- to 6,050 yen -LRB- $ 42.60 -RRB- . \nKyocera advanced 80 yen to 5,440 . \nFanuc gained 100 to 7,580 . \nBreweries attracted investors because of their land property holdings that could figure in development or other plans , traders said . \nSapporo gained 80 to 1,920 and Kirin added 60 to 2,070 . \nHousings , constructions and pharmaceuticals continued to be bought following Thursday 's gains because of strong earnings outlooks . \nDaiwa House gained 50 to 2,660 . \nMisawa Homes was up 20 at 2,960 . \nKajima advanced 40 to 2,120 and Ohbayashi added 50 to 1,730 . \nFujisawa added 80 to 2,010 and Mochida advanced 230 to 4,400 . \nLondon share prices were influenced largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the British pound . \nThe key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1 , above its intraday low of 2176.9 , but off the day 's high of 2189 . \nThe index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street 's fall . \nLondon was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September . \nThe FT-SE 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower . \nThe FT 30-share index closed 11.0 points lower at 1761.0 . \nVolume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares . \nDealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday . \nThey added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE 100 shares . \nInterest may remain limited into tomorrow 's U.K. trade figures , which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months . \nThe key corporate news of the day was that British Airways decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for UAL Corp. , the parent of United Airlines . \nBritish Airways rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the UAL deal . \nDealers said they viewed the initial # 390-million -LRB- $ 622 million -RRB- outlay for a 15 % stake in the airline as a bit much . \nIts shares slid in late dealings to close a penny per share lower at 197 pence . \nThe airline was the most active FT-SE 100 at 8.2 million shares traded . \nThe next most active top-tier stock was B.A.T Industries , the target of Sir James Goldsmith 's # 13.4 billion bid . \nThe company gained shareholder approval Thursday to restructure in a bid to fend off the hostile takeover . \nSir James said Thursday night that his plans for the takeover had n't changed . \nB.A.T ended the day at 778 , down 5 , on turnover of 7.5 million shares . \nDealers said it was hit by some profit-taking after gains since mid-week . \nIn other active shares , Trusthouse Forte shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgrading , while Hillsdown Holdings , a food products concern , was boosted 2 to 271 after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases . \nElsewhere in Europe , share prices closed higher in Stockholm , Brussels and Milan . \nPrices were lower in Frankfurt , Zurich , Paris and Amsterdam . \nSouth African gold stocks closed moderately lower . \nShare prices closed higher in Sydney , Taipei , Wellington , Manila , Hong Kong and Singapore and were lower in Seoul . \nHere are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as

year-end . \nThe U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives , government officials said . \nThe notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee . \nThe existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday . \nOfficials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . \nAccording to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . \nThey said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort . \nNo notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . \nWhat 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . \nThe rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules . \nHowever , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . \nIt has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad . \nA statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama . \nThe statement added , `` Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government . \nNot only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust we have all worked to develop . '' \nSen. Boren said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future . \nI 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . '' \nRepublican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . '' \nSen. Boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules . \nBut the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress . \nInstead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October . \nThe guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations . \nIn fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to . \nOne administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life . \nBut a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S. . \nAlthough the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama . \nOne senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble . \nThe issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts . \nIn addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . \nThough the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . \nLast week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups . \nThe administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action . \nHowever , last week Mr. Webster 's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in Panama . \nNevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president . \nThe three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders . \nThe new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed . \nGerald F.

H. postponed their formal endorsement of a merger with Daimler-Benz AG until another meeting on Nov. 17 . \nThe owners of the defense and aerospace concern , which include three regional states , several industrial companies and banks , met Friday to discuss the final terms of the transaction , in which Daimler-Benz will acquire 50.01 % of \nBut agreement aparently could n't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen , which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region . \nThe two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB , but their stake will fall to around 30 % after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern . \nJeffrey E. Levin was named vice president and chief economist of this commodity futures and options exchange . \nHe had been associate professor in the department of finance at Seton Hall University . \nSIERRA TUCSON Cos. said it completed its initial public offering of 2.5 million common shares , which raised $ 30 million . \nThe Tucson , Ariz. , operator of addiction-treatment centers said proceeds will be used for expansion , to pay debt and for general corporate purposes . \nOppenheimer & Co. was the lead underwriter . \nThe government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation . \nThe consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York . \nBut inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report , is expected to rise only 3.5 % , down from 4.6 % in the second quarter . \n`` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , in Chicago . \n`` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added . \nThe week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate . \nMost are expected to fall below previous-month levels . \nMany economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession . \nIn addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter . \nThe recent one-day , 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported . \n`` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington . \nThe economy , he noted , moves the market , not vice versa . \nOn the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . '' \nHis estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate . \nDemand , he believes , is being met from overhang rather than new production . \nBy and large , economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions . \nEdward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . \nGary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior . \nHe expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures . \nSung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports . \nThe consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption . \nIn August , personal income rose 0.4 % and personal consumption increased 0.9 % . \nCharles Lieberman , managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. , New York , said Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1 % to 0.2 % from personal-income growth , because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism . \nDurable goods orders for September , due out tomorrow , are expected to show a slip of 1 % , compared with August 's 3.9 % increase . \nAs usual , estimates on the fickle report are wide , running from a drop of 3.5 % to a gain of 1.6 % . \nHASTINGS MANUFACTURING Co. declared a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share and an extra dividend of five cents a share on its common stock , payable Dec. 15 to shares of record Nov. 17 . \nThis is the 11th consecutive quarter in which the company has paid shareholders an extra dividend of five cents . \nThe Hastings , Mich. , concern makes piston rings , filters and fuel pumps . \nVickers PLC , a United Kingdom defense and engineering company , said an investment unit controlled by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02 % from about 14.6 % Thursday and from 13.7 % the previous week . \nI.E.P. Securities Ltd. , a unit of Mr. Brierley 's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity -LRB- Pacific -RRB- Ltd. , boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares . \nThe latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months . \nIn May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year . \n`` Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment , '' a Vickers spokesman said . \nThe spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company . \nVickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses . \nWhen Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants . \n`` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls . \nYet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials . \nIt was a gutsy move for a little-known executive , fired after only two months as president of his previous company . \nBut going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson . \nStroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive Swede quips : `` It turned out to be lucky for us . \nIf the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition . '' \nMr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet . \nCharacteristically , he did n't waste much time getting started . \nOn Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange . \nAt current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 386 million -RRB- to Trelleborg 's coffers , analysts say . \nThe board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares . \nBut that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say . \nTrelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 -LRB- $ 4.48 -RRB- to SKr205 -LRB- $ 31.65 -RRB- in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm . \nTuesday , the shares regained SKr20 , closing at SKr225 . \nMr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down Trelleborg 's share price . \nTrelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units . \nThe spinoff should solve a problem for the parent . \nA family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding . \nBut the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % . \nThat possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding . \nThat growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years . \nMost of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers . \nApplying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux , Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results . \nThe treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns . \nBetween 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold . \nMany analysts expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year . \nBut the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas . '' \nLast month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . \nIndustry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . \n`` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . \n`` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . '' \nBut Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles . \nMr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . '' \nBooming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier . \nBut analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth . \nMining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business . \nAnalysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture . \nNoranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid . \nSome analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf . \nMr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up . \nFalconbridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form . \n`` We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company . \nBut such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's president says . \nPerhaps more important , both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries . \n`` If the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will be the investment decade , '' Mr. Andersson says . \n`` The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says . \n`` That 's beginning to change . \nAnd investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses Trelleborg is in . \nApple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a $ 48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc . \nExcluding the gain , the company registered a modest 4.6 % increase for the quarter ended Sept. 29 to $ 113 million , or 87 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 107.9 million , or 84 cents a share . \nProceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $ 161.1 million , or $ 1.24 a share . \nApple shares fell 75 cents in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 48 a share . \nFiscal fourth-quarter sales grew about 18 % to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.17 billion a year earlier . \nWithout the Adobe gain , Apple 's full-year operating profit edged up 1.5 % to $ 406 million , or $ 3.16 a share , from $ 400.3 million , or $ 3.08 a share . \nIncluding the Adobe gain , full-year net was $ 454 million , or $ 3.53 a share . \nSales for the year rose nearly 30 % to $ 5.28 billion from $ 4.07 billion a year earlier . \nJohn Sculley , chairman and chief executive officer , credited the Macintosh SE\\/30 and IIcx computers , introduced in the winter , for the brightened sales performance . \nMr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins , which dogged the company through most of 1989 , began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased . \n`` Adverse pressure on gross margins ... has subsided , '' Mr. Sculley said . \nMargins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up , rising to 51 % from 49.2 % a year earlier . \nFor all of fiscal 1989 , however , the average gross margin was 49 % , below the average 1988 gross margin of 51 % . \nLower component costs -- especially for DRAMs , or dynamic random access memory chips -- were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company , a spokeswoman said . \nLooking ahead to 1990 , Mr. Sculley predicted `` another year of significant revenue growth , '' along with improved profitability , as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990 . \nGary J. Schantz , 44 years old , was named president and chief operating officer . \nPolymerix makes lumber-like materials that it describes as `` plastic wood . '' \nThe operating chief 's post is new . \nMartin Schrager , 51 , who had been president , was named vice chairman . \nHe remains chief executive officer . \nMr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp . \nSeparately , the board expanded to six members with the election of David L. Holewinski , a consultant . \nThe company also said it privately placed stock and warrants in exchange for $ 750,000 . \nTerry L. Haines , formerly general manager of Canadian operations , was elected to the new position of vice president , North American sales , of this plastics concern . \nAlso , Larry A. Kushkin , executive vice president , North American operations , was named head of the company 's international automotive operations , another new position . \nHe remains an executive vice president , the company said , and his new position reflects `` the growing importance of the world automotive market as a market for A. Schulman 's high performance plastic materials . '' \nGordon Trimmer will succeed Mr. Haines as manager of Canadian operations , and Mr. Kushkin 's former position is n't being filled at this time , the company said . \nGeneral Electric Co. said it signed a contract with the developers of the Ocean State Power project for the second phase of an independent $ 400 million power plant , which is being built in Burrillville , R.I . \nGE , along with a division of Ebasco , a subsidiary of Enserch Corp. , have been building the first 250-megawatt phase of the project , which they expect to complete in late 1990 . \nThe second portion will be completed the following year . \nGE 's Power Generation subsidiary will operate and maintain the plant upon its completion . \nThe Environmental Protection Agency is getting a lot out of the Superfund program . \nOf the $ 4.4 billion spent so far on the program , 60 % is going for administrative costs , management and research , the Office of Technology Assessment just reported . \nOnly 36 of 1,200 priority cleanup sites have been `` decontaminated . '' \nOver the next 50 years , $ 500 billion is earmarked for the program . \nAt current allocations , that means EPA will be spending $ 300 billion on itself . \nIt may not be toxic , but we know where one waste dump is . \nChambers Development Co. said its Security Bureau Inc. unit purchased two security concerns in Florida that will add $ 2.1 million of annual revenue . \nPurchase of the businesses serving Miami , Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach , Fla. , is part of a plan by Chambers to expand in the growing security industry . \nTerms were n't disclosed . \nBasf AG said it moved its headquarters for Latin America to Mexico and the headquarters for the Asia\\/Australia regional division to Singapore , effective Oct . \nThe central offices for both regions were previously located in Ludwigshafen , Basf headquarters . \nThe West German chemical concern called the moves a further step in the internationalization of its business activities . \nBoth regions are the fastest-growing areas for Basf , the company said . \nDavid H. Eisenberg , 53 years old , was named president and chief operating officer of Imasco 's 500-store Peoples Drug Stores Inc. unit , based in Alexandria , Va . \nMr. Eisenberg was senior executive vice president and chief operating officer . \nImasco is a tobacco , retailing , restaurant and financial services concern . \nLotus Development Corp. is in talks to sell its Signal stock-quote service to Infotechnology Inc. , the New York parent of Financial News Network , people familiar with the negotiations said . \nThey said the price would be around $ 10 million . \nSignal , which has an estimated 10,000 subscribers and is profitable , provides stock quotes over an FM radio band that can be received by specially equipped personal computers . \nThe computers will display stock prices selected by users . \nLotus , Cambridge , Mass. , has been rumored to have the sale of the four-year-old unit under consideration for a year . \nThe business is n't related to Lotus 's main businesses of making computer software and publishing information on compact disks . \n`` Please submit your offers , '' says Felipe Bince Jr . \nHe surveys the prospective investors gathered in the board room of the Philippine government 's Asset Privatization Trust for the sale of a 36 % interest in the country 's largest paper mill . \nThe agency expects the bids to be equivalent of more than $ 80 million . \nNot a peso is offered . \nMr. Bince , the trust 's associate executive trustee , declares the bidding a failure . \n`` It 's getting harder to sell , '' he mutters as he leaves the room . \nIndeed . Recently , the trust failed to auction off the paper mill , a bank , an office building and a small cotton-ginning plant . \nOf the four , only the bank and the plant drew bids -- one apiece . \nIn October 1987 , President Corazon Aquino vowed that her government would `` get out of business '' by selling all or part of the state 's holdings in the many companies taken over by the government during the 20-year rule of Ferdinand Marcos . \nTwo years later , Mrs. Aquino 's promise remains largely unfulfilled . \nOctober is a critical month for the privatization program . \nManila is offering several major assets for the first time and is trying to conclude sales already arranged . \nIn addition , the government is scheduled to unveil plans for privatizing Philippine Airlines , the national carrier , an effort that lawyer and business columnist Rodolfo Romero calls `` the bellwether of privatization . '' \nAll told , there are assets on the line valued at up to $ 1.03 billion . \nThe privatization program is designed to rid the government of hundreds of assets and to raise critically needed funds . \nMuch of the money from the sales is earmarked for a multibillion-dollar agrarian-reform program . \nBut efforts have been thwarted by official indifference , bureaucratic resistance , a legal system that operates at a snail 's pace , political opposition and government misjudgments . \nMost recently , a lack of buyers has been added to the list . \nRather than gathering momentum , the program is in danger of slowing even more as the government tackles several big assets . \nThe axiom appears to be that the more valuable the asset , the harder the privatization process . \n`` You just do n't see a whole lot happening , '' says an international economist . \nTo be sure , the program has n't completely stalled . \nThe Asset Privatization Trust , the agency chiefly responsible for selling government-held properties , has recorded sales of more than $ 500 million since it began functioning in December 1986 . \nBut its success has been largely in the sale of small , nonperforming companies , which are valued for their assets . \nDealing with the sales this month could be particularly challenging because almost every problem that has hobbled the program in the past is popping up again . \nRamon Garcia , the Asset Trust 's executive trustee , admits to what he calls `` temporary setbacks . '' \nIn light of the poor results recently , he says , the agency is adopting an `` attitude of flexibility . '' \nOctober 's troubles began when the trust failed to sell a state-owned commercial bank , Associated Bank , for the minimum price of 671 million pesos -LRB- $ 31 million -RRB- . \nAt the end of the month , the agency again will offer the bank . \nBut instead of a minimum price , only a target price will be established . \nBankers say , however , that the government may have difficulty selling the institution even without a floor price . \nThe bank has a negative net worth , they say . \nIn addition , special bidding rules give the bank 's former owner , Leonardo Ty , the right to match the highest bid . \nMr. Ty lost control to the government in 1980 when a government bank made emergency loans to the cash-strapped institution . \nIn 1983 , the loans were converted into equity , giving Manila 98 % of the bank , but with the understanding that Mr. Ty had repurchase rights . \nHis ability to match any bid has scared off many potential buyers . \nSeparately , the government will try again within a month to sell the 36 % stake in Paper Industries Corp. of the Philippines , or Picop , as the paper mill is known . \nThe price will depend on how much Picop shares fetch on the local stock market . \nBut according to bankers and stock analysts who have studied the paper mill , price is n't the only consideration . \nAs it stands now , the government would continue to hold 45 % of Picop after the 36 % stake is sold . \n-LRB- About 7.5 % of Picop is publicly traded and other shareholders own the rest of the equity . -RRB- \nPotential buyers , mostly foreign companies , are reluctant to take a non-controlling stake in a company that , by the government 's own reckoning , needs some $ 100 million in new capital for rehabilitation . \nThe prospect of buying into a cash-hungry company without getting management control persuaded at least three foreign buyers , including a member of the Elders group of Australia , to pull out of the bidding , the bankers and analysts say . \nMr. Garcia acknowledges the problem and says the Asset Trust will study why the bidding failed and what changes the agency may be able to offer . \nUnder government regulations , however , foreign ownership of Picop 's equity is limited to 40 % . \nEven though the government would retain the 45 % stake in Picop , critics have accused the trust of selling out to foreigners . \nA series of newspaper articles accused the trust of short-changing the government over the Picop sale . \nMr. Garcia says he has been notified of congressional hearings on the Picop bidding and possible legislation covering the paper mill 's sale , both prompted by the criticism of the agency . \nThe question of control could further hinder long-delayed plans for the government to divest itself of Philippine Airlines , in which it has a 99 % stake . \nThe carrier has valuable trans-Pacific and Asian routes but it remains debt-laden and poorly managed . \nThis maker of electronic measuring devices named two new directors , increasing board membership to nine . \nThe new directors are Gordon M. Sprenger , president and chief executive officer of LifeSpan Inc. , and Peter S. Willmott , chairman and chief executive officer of Willmott Services Inc . \nGerard E. Wood , 51 years old , was elected president , chief executive officer and a director of this minerals and materials company . \nHe succeeds Harry A. Durney , 65 , who is retiring from active duty but remains a director and consultant . \nMr. Wood has been president and chief executive of Steep Rock Resources Inc . \nEagle Financial Corp. and Webster Financial Corp. , two Connecticut savings bank-holding companies , agreed to merge in a tax-free stock transaction . \nThe new holding company , Webster\\/Eagle Bancorp Inc. , will have about $ 1.2 billion of assets and 19 banking offices in Connecticut . \nTangible capital will be about $ 115 million . \nThe merger is subject to regulatory clearance and a definitive agreement . \nIn the merger , each share of Webster , based in Waterbury , will be converted into one share of the new company . \nEach share of Eagle , based in Bristol , will become 0.95 share of Webster\\/Eagle . \nIn American Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Eagle shares rose 12.5 cents to $ 11 . \nIn national over-the-counter trading , Webster shares fell 25 cents to $ 12.375 . \nWebster has 3.5 million shares outstanding and Eagle 2.6 million . \nTheir indicated market values thus are about $ 43.3 million and $ 28.6 million , respectively . \nFrank J. Pascale , chairman of Eagle , will be chairman of the new firm and James C. Smith , president and chief executive officer of Webster , will take those posts at Webster\\/Eagle . \nHarold W. Smith Sr. , chairman of Webster , will become chairman emeritus and a director of the new company . \nRalph T. Linsley , vice chairman of Eagle , will become vice chairman of Webster\\/Eagle . \nThe board will be made up of seven directors of each holding company . \nIn an interview , James Smith said the banks ' `` markets are contiguous and their business philosophies are similar and conservative . '' \nNonperforming loans will make up only about 0.5 % of the combined banks ' total loans outstanding , he said . \nAt June 30 , Webster , which owns First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Waterbury , had assets of $ 699 million . \nEagle , which controls Bristol Federal Savings Bank and First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Torrington , had assets of $ 469.6 million on that date . \nGuillermo Ortiz 's Sept. 15 Americas column , `` Mexico 's Been Bitten by the Privatization Bug , '' is a refreshingly clear statement of his government 's commitment to privatization , and must be welcomed as such by all Americans who wish his country well . \nThe Mexico-United States Institute is glad to see such a high official as Mexico 's undersecretary of finance view his country 's reforms `` in the context of a larger , world-wide process '' of profound change toward free-market economics , especially in the statist countries . \nHaving said that , we must caution against an apparent tendency to overstate the case . \nIt is not quite true , for example , that the Mexican government has `` privatized '' Mexicana de Aviacion , as Mr. Ortiz claims . \nIn the same sentence he contradicts himself when he reports that the government still retains 40 % of the total equity of the airline . \nHow can a company be considered `` privatized '' if the state is so heavily represented in it ? \n-LRB- True , the Mexican government has granted `` control '' over the airline to a new private consortium , but its propensity to take back what it gives is too well known to permit one to be sanguine . -RRB- \nRegrettably , too , Mr. Ortiz resorts to the familiar `` numbers game '' when he boasts that `` fewer than 392 -LCB- state enterprises -RCB- currently remain in the public sector , '' down from the `` 1,155 public entities that existed in 1982 . \n'' But the enterprises still in state hands include the biggest and most economically powerful ones in Mexico ; indeed , they virtually constitute the economic infrastructure . \nI refer essentially to petroleum , electric power , banking and newsprint . \nThose enterprises , however , are not going to be privatized . \nThey are officially considered `` strategic , '' and their privatization is prohibited by the Mexican Constitution . \nIn language that sidesteps the issue , Mr. Ortiz writes , `` The divestiture of nonpriority and nonstrategic public enterprises is an essential element of President Carlos Salinas 's plan to modernize Mexico 's economy ... . '' \nYet clearly , modernization must embrace its key industries before it can be said to have caught the `` privatization bug . '' \nThe bottom line , however , is not economic but political reform . \nA long succession of Mexican presidents arbitrarily nationalized whatever industry they took a fancy to , without having to answer to the public . \nTo guarantee that Mexicana de Aviacion and other companies will really be privatized , Mexico needs a pluri-party political system that will ensure democracy and hence accountability . \nDaniel James President Mexico-United States Institute \nThe board of this Ponce , Puerto Rico concern voted to suspend payment of its quarterly of 11 cents a share for the third quarter . \nThe third-largest thrift institution in Puerto Rico also said it expects a return to profitability in the third quarter when it reports operating results this week . \nPonce Federal said the dividend was suspended in anticipation of more stringent capital requirements under the Financial Institutions Reform , Recovery , and Enforcement Act of 1989 . \nA labor-management group is preparing a revised buy-out bid for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. that would transfer majority ownership to employees while leaving some stock in public hands , according to people familiar with the group . \nThe group has been discussing a proposal valued in a range of $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or $ 5.09 billion to $ 5.42 billion . \nBut to avoid the risk of rejection , the group does n't plan to submit the plan formally at a UAL board meeting today . \nInstead , the group is raising the proposal informally to try to test the board 's reaction . \nPeople familiar with the company say the board is n't likely to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share , $ 6.79 billion buy-out bid that collapsed last week after banks would n't raise needed loans and after a key partner , British Airways PLC , dropped out . \nIn composite trading Friday on the New York Stock Exchange , UAL closed at $ 168.50 a share , down $ 21.625 . \nBut the pilots union , which has been pushing for a takeover since 1987 , appears to be pressing ahead with the revised bid to avoid further loss of momentum even though it has n't found a partner to replace British Air . \nAlthough the bidding group has n't had time to develop its latest idea fully or to discuss it with banks , it believes bank financing could be obtained . \nAfter the collapse of the last effort , the group does n't plan to make any formal proposal without binding commitments from banks covering the entire amount to be borrowed . \nUnder the type of transaction being discussed , the pilot-management group would borrow several billion dollars from banks that could then be used to finance a cash payment to current holders . \nThose current holders would also receive minority interests in the new company . \nFor example , the group could offer $ 200 a share in cash plus stock valued at $ 30 a share . \nUAL currently has 22.6 million shares , fully diluted . \nThe new structure would be similar to a recapitalization in which holders get a special dividend yet retain a controlling ownership interest . \nThe difference is that current holders would n't retain majority ownership or control . \nThe failed takeover would have given UAL employees 75 % voting control of the nation 's second-largest airline , with management getting 10 % control and British Air 15 % . \nIt was n't clear how the ownership would stack up under the new plan , but employees would keep more than 50 % . \nManagement 's total could be reduced , and the public could get more than the 15 % control that had been earmarked for British Air . \nOne option the board is likely to consider today is some sort of cooling-off period . \nAlthough the pilots are expected to continue to pursue the bid , UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf may be asked to withdraw from the buy-out effort , at least temporarily , and to return to running the company full time . \nThe board could eventually come under some pressure to sell the company because its members can be ousted by a majority shareholder vote , particularly since one-third of UAL stock is held by takeover stock speculators who favor a sale . \nThe labor-management buy-out group plans to keep its offer on the table in an apparent attempt to maintain its bargaining position with the board . \nHowever , the only outsider who has emerged to lead such a shareholder vote , Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis , who triggered the buy-out with a $ 5.4 billion bid in early August , is hanging back -- apparently to avoid being blamed for contributing to the deal 's collapse . \nThree top advisers to Mr. Davis visited New York late last week , at least in part to confer with executives at Citicorp . \nMr. Davis had paid $ 6 million for Citicorp 's backing of his last bid . \nBut Citicorp has lost some credibility because it also led the unsuccessful effort to gain bank loans for the labor-management group . \nOn Friday , British Air issued a statement saying it `` does not intend to participate in any new deal for the acquisition of UAL in the foreseeable future . '' \nHowever , several people said that British Air might yet rejoin the bidding group and that the carrier made the statement to answer questions from British regulators about how it plans to use proceeds of a securities offering previously earmarked for the UAL buy-out . \nAlso late last week , UAL flight attendants agreed to participate with the pilots in crafting a revised offer . \nBut the machinists union , whose opposition helped scuttle the first buy-out bid , is likely to favor a recapitalization with a friendly third-party investor . \nOne advantage the buy-out group intends to press with the board is that pilots have agreed to make $ 200 million in annual cost concessions to help finance a bid . \nSpeculation has also arisen that the UAL executive most closely identified with the failure to gain bank financing , chief financial officer John Pope , may come under pressure to resign . \nHowever , people familiar with the buy-out group said Mr. Pope 's departure would weaken the airline 's management at a critical time . \nDespite the buy-out group 's failure to obtain financing , UAL remains obligated to pay $ 26.7 million in investment banking and legal fees to the group 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. , Salomon Brothers Inc. , and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison . \nWhittle Communications Limited Partnership , Knoxville , Tenn. , will launch its first media property targeting Hispanic women . \n`` La Familia de Hoy , '' or `` Today 's Family , '' will debut this spring and will combine a national bimonthly magazine and TV programming . \nThe television element of `` La Familia '' includes a series of two-minute informational features to air seven days a week on the Spanish-language Univision network , a unit of Univision Holdings Inc. , which is 80%-owned by Hallmark Cards Inc . \nThe features will focus on `` parenting , family health and nutrition , and financial management , '' and will carry 30 seconds of advertising . \nThe magazines , also ad-supported , will be distributed in more than 10,000 doctors ' offices , clinics , and health centers in Hispanic and largely Hispanic communities . \nWEIRTON STEEL Corp. said it completed a $ 300 million sale of 10-year notes , the final step in the 1984 buy-out of the company from National Steel Corp . \nThe 10 7\\/8 % notes were priced at 99.5 % to yield 10.958 % in an offering managed by Bear , Stearns & Co. , Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Lazard Freres & Co. , the company said . \nWeirton , of Weirton , W. Va. , said $ 60.3 million of the proceeds were used to prepay the remaining amounts on the note outstanding to National Intergroup Inc. , the parent of National Steel . \nRemaining proceeds were used to pay other debt and to finance the company 's capital spending program . \nLep Group PLC of Britain , which holds a 62.42 % stake in Profit Systems Inc. , said it is considering courses of action that could result in its having `` active control '' of the company . \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lep Group said a possible course of action may include acquiring some or all of the Profit Systems shares it does n't already own . \nIt noted , however , that it has n't determined any specific terms of a possible transaction . \nLep Group and affiliates currently control 3,513,072 Profit Systems common shares , or 62.42 % , the filing said . \nProfit Systems , Valley Stream , N.Y. , is an air freight forwarding concern . \nU.S. official reserve assets rose $ 6.05 billion in September , to $ 68.42 billion , the Treasury Department said . \nThe gain compared with a $ 1.10 billion decline in reserve assets in August to $ 62.36 billion , the department said . \nU.S. reserve assets consist of foreign currencies , gold , special drawing rights at the International Monetary Fund and the U.S. reserve position -- its ability to draw foreign currencies -- at the IMF . \nThe nation 's holdings of foreign currencies increased $ 5.67 billion in September to $ 39.08 billion , while its gold reserves were virtually unchanged at $ 11.07 billion . \nU.S. holdings of IMF special drawing rights last month rose $ 247 million , to $ 9.49 billion , and its reserve position at the IMF increased $ 142 million , to $ 8.79 billion . \nAlusuisse of America Inc. plans to sell its Consolidated Aluminum Corp. subsidiary as part of its strategy to focus more on aluminum packaging in the U.S. . \nAlusuisse , of New York , declined to say how much it expects to get for the unit ; the company has hired First Boston Corp. to help identify bidders . \nAlusuisse is a subsidiary of Swiss Aluminium Ltd. , a Zurich , Switzerland , producer of aluminum , chemicals and packaging products . \nConsolidated , which had 1988 revenue of $ 400 million , makes aluminum sheet and foil products at its Hannibal , Ohio , and Jackson , Tenn. , rolling mills and recycles aluminum at a plant in Bens Run , W.Va . \nManhattan National Corp. said Michael A. Conway , president and chief executive officer , was elected chief executive of the holding company 's two principal insurance subsidiaries . \nHe succeeds Paul P. Aniskovich Jr. , who resigned to pursue other business interests , the company said . \nMr. Conway , 42 years old , was elected chairman , president and chief executive of Manhattan Life Insurance Co. and president and chief executive of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co . \nHarry Rossi , 69 , chairman of the holding company , also remains chairman of Manhattan National Life Insurance Co . \nMr. Conway was executive vice president and chief investment officer of Union Central Life Insurance Co. , of Cincinnati , in 1987 , when Union Central bought a 54 % interest in Manhattan National Corp . \nHe resigned as an officer of Central Life to accept the Manhattan National presidency . \nDaniel J. Terra , a director of First Illinois Corp. , said that in August he reduced his stake in First Illinois to 26.48 % of the common shares outstanding . \nIn a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Mr. Terra said he sold 263,684 First Illinois common shares from Aug. 9 to Aug. 28 for $ 9.9375 to $ 10.5625 a share . \nAs a result of the sales he holds 6,727,042 shares . \nMr. Terra said in the filing that he sold the stock to decrease his position in the Evanston , Ill. , banking concern . \nHe may sell more shares in the open market or in private transactions , but would n't rule out changing his intentions and buying shares , the filing said . \nSciMed Life Systems Inc. , Minneapolis , said a federal appeals court vacated an earlier summary judgment in its favor . \nA lower court in St. Paul had ruled in September 1988 that a heart catheter SciMed manufactures does n't infringe on a patent owned by Advanced Cardiovascular Systems , a unit of Eli Lilly & Co . \nSciMed said the appeals court remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings . \nIn national over-the-counter trading Friday , SciMed shares tumbled $ 2.75 to $ 43 . \nSciMed said it `` remains committed '' both to the `` vigorous defense '' of its position that the catheter does n't infringe the Lilly unit 's patent , and to the pursuit of its own counterclaims , which allege Lilly engaged in antitrust violations and other wrongful acts . \nA REVISED BID FOR UAL is being prepared by a labor-management group , sources said . \nThe new proposal , which would transfer majority ownership of United Air 's parent to employees and leave some stock in public hands , would be valued at $ 225 to $ 240 a share , or as much as $ 5.42 billion . \nBut UAL 's board is n't expected to give quick approval to any offer substantially below the $ 300-a-share bid that collapsed recently . \nTakeover stock speculators have incurred paper losses of over $ 700 million from the failed UAL offer , their worst loss ever on a single deal . \nFord and Saab ended talks about a possible alliance after Ford concluded that the cost to modernize Saab 's car operations would outweigh the likely return . \nThe collapse Friday prompted speculation that Ford would intensify its pursuit of Jaguar , which is negotiating a defensive alliance with GM . \nStock prices edged up in quiet trading Friday . \nThe Dow Jones industrials rose 5.94 , to 2689.14 , making the gain for the week a record 119.88 points , or 4.7 % . \nMost bond prices fell , but junk bonds and the dollar rose . \nNew York City bonds were sold off by many investors last week amid political and economic uncertainty . \nMore banks are being hurt by Arizona 's worsening real-estate slump . \nFirst Interstate Bancorp of Los Angeles said Friday it expects a $ 16 million quarterly loss , citing property-loan losses at its Arizona unit . \nOPEC 's ability to produce more oil than it can sell is starting to cast a shadow over world oil markets . \nOPEC officials worry that prices could collapse a few months from now if the group does n't adopt new quotas . \nSaatchi & Saatchi has attracted offers for some of its advertising units but has rejected them , sources said . \nThe proposals , from suitors including Interpublic Group , come as the London-based ad giant struggles through its most difficult period ever . \nQintex Australia suffered another setback Friday when its Los Angeles-based affiliate filed for Chapter 11 protection . \nQintex 's $ 1.5 billion pact to buy MGM\\/UA collapsed recently . \nKodak entered the high-definition television market by unveiling a device that can convert conventional film into high-definition video . \nA handful of small U.S. firms are refusing to cede the HDTV-screen market to Japanese manufacturers . \nFreight rates are bottoming out and starting to rebound . \nTrucking , shipping and air-freight firms are all planning rate increases , reflecting higher costs and tightened demand . \nTexaco has purchased an oil-producing company in Texas for $ 476.5 million . \nIt is Texaco 's first major acquisition since the legal battle with Pennzoil began over four years ago . \nWinnebago posted a widened quarterly loss and slashed its dividend in half , reflecting the deepening slowdown in recreational vehicle sales . \nMarkets -- \nStocks : \nVolume 164,830,000 shares . \nDow Jones industrials 2689.14 , up 5.94 ;

1.8578 marks , up 0.0108 . \nInmac Corp. , a money-losing direct marketer of computer supplies and accessories , said directors suspended payment of its semiannual dividend as too great a drain on funds . \nThe company paid five cents a share in April . \nThe directors ' action , taken Oct. 10 but announced Friday , had little or no effect on the company 's stock , which stagnated at $ 4.75 in light over-the-counter trading . \nInmac recently disclosed a $ 12.3 million write-off related to a corporate restructuring that resulted in the company 's posting a $ 6.4 million net loss for the year ended July 29 , compared with year-earlier profit of $ 9.7 million , or $ 1.02 a share . \nSales rose 12 % to $ 249.5 million from $ 222.8 million . \n`` The board felt that the continued payment of our semiannual dividend was inconsistent with recent operating results , '' said Kenneth A. Eldred , president and chief executive officer . \n`` All our efforts are now focused on improving earnings to the point where we can fund additional new-country development , continue to invest in the business and reinstate the dividend , '' he added . \nThe company offers more than 3,500 parts and supplies directly to microcomputer and minicomputer users through catalog sales . \nThe Food and Drug Administration said American Home Products Corp. agreed to recall certain generic drugs that were produced by its Quantum Pharmics unit in Amityville , N.Y . \nQuantum stopped shipping the drugs last month , following a federal investigation regarding information the company supplied to obtain three drug approvals . \nThe FDA requested the recall of Quantum 's mioxidil tablets , chlorazepate dipotassium tablets and meclofenamate sodium capsules because , it said , the size of the production runs submitted for testing to gain FDA approval was in each case misrepresented as much larger than it actually was . \nAmerican Home Products , based in New York , agreed to recall four other products , trazadone , doxepin , diazepam and lorazapam , because of concerns about data submitted in their original approval applications before the FDA . \nNo safety problems with the products are known , the FDA said . \nAn FDA spokesperson said the drugs are still available under other brand names . \nLast month , American Home Products said it was suspending production and distribution of all 21 of Quantum 's generic drug products pending the completion of an exhaustive internal audit . \nIt also temporarily closed Quantum , because of the internal investigation , as well as the FDA 's ongoing inquiry . \nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading , American Home Products rose 75 cents to $ 105 on Friday . \nLyondell Petrochemical Co. said third-quarter net income fell 54 % , to $ 73 million , or 91 cents a share , from $ 160 million a year earlier . \nYear-earlier per-share results are n't applicable because the company went public in January . \nRevenue rose 7.7 % to $ 1.28 billion from $ 1.18 billion . \nThe petrochemical maker said the biggest reason earnings declined was a loss of production time and the increased costs associated with a temporary maintenance closing and expansion of an olefins plant . \nLike other refiners , Lyondell 's margins for chemicals and gasoline were narrower . \nWhile the company said chemical margins continued to worsen this quarter , costs will be lower because the maintenance and expansions are complete . \nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday , Lyondell was unchanged at $ 18.50 a share . \nFour former Cordis Corp. officials were acquitted of federal charges related to the Miami-based company 's sale of pacemakers , including conspiracy to hide pacemaker defects . \nJurors in U.S. District Court in Miami cleared Harold Hershhenson , a former executive vice president ; John Pagones , a former vice president ; and Stephen Vadas and Dean Ciporkin , who had been engineers with Cordis . \nEarlier this year , Cordis , a maker of medical devices , agreed to plead guilty to felony and misdemeanor charges related to the pacemakers and to pay the government about $ 5.7 million in fines and other costs . \nCordis sold its pacemaker operations two years ago to Telectronics Holding Ltd. of Australia . \nPAPERS : \nManagement and unions representing 2,400 employees at Torstar Corp. 's Toronto Star reached a tentative contract agreement Friday , averting a strike by most employees of Canada 's largest daily newspaper . \nMembers of the largest union , representing 1,700 workers , voted in favor of the pact yesterday . \nFour other unions have yet to vote , but their leadership also recommended approval . \nThe pact proposes a 2 1\\/2-year contract with a raise of 8 % in the first year , 7 % in the second and 4 % for the final six months . \nAmgen Inc. said its second-quarter earnings increased more than tenfold to $ 3.9 million , or 22 cents a share , due to increased sales of the company 's new antianemia drug for kidney patients . \nThe Thousand Oaks , Calif.-based biotechnology company reported a 97 % increase in revenue to $ 42.5 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30 . \nIn the year-ago period , Amgen reported net income of $ 320,000 , or two cents a share , on revenue of $ 21.5 million . \nFor the six months , the company reported a more than sixfold increase in earnings to $ 4.7 million , or 26 cents a share , from $ 625,000 , or four cents a share a year ago . \nRevenue rose 77 % to $ 72.6 million , from last year 's $ 41 million . \nLEBANESE LAWMAKERS APPROVED a peace plan but Aoun rejected it . \nLebanon 's Parliament passed the power-sharing accord to end the country 's 14-year-old conflict , but the Christian military leader wad the plan was `` full of ambiguities . '' \nThe Arab League-sponsored pact , drafted during three weeks of talks at the Saudi Arabian resort of Taif , includes Syrian proposals for at least a partial troop pullout from Lebanon , and guarantees an equal number of seats for Moslems and Christians in the Parliament . \nThe rejection by Aoun , who has demanded a total and immediate pull-out of Damascus 's 33,000 troops , puts the future of the agreement in doubt . \nNORTHERN CALIFORNIA BRACED for earthquake-related traffic jams . \nAs rescuers pressed their efforts after finding a survivor in a collapsed freeway , the San Francisco Bay area girded for hundreds of thousands of commuters seeking to avoid routes ravaged by last Tuesday 's tremor . \nIn Oakland , officials said the 57-year-old longshoreman who spent four days entombed in rubble was in critical condition with slight improvement . \nEstimates of damage in the area , visited Friday by Bush , topped $ 5 billion . \nThe baseball commissioner announced that the third game of the World Series between the Giants and the Athletics would n't resume until Friday . \nTHE U.S. . IS REQUIRED to notify foreign dictators of certain coup plans . \nUnder guidelines included in an exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence panel last year , the U.S. must inform foreign dictators of plans likely to endanger their lives . \nThe existence of the policy became known after Bush disclosed it to seven GOP senators last week , citing the plan as an example of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of covert actions , officials said . \nBush conceded that the requirement did n't affect a decision to lend only minor support to this month 's failed effort to oust Panama 's Noriega , aides said . \nThe shuttle Atlantis 's crew prepared to return to Earth today several hours earlier than planned to avoid high winds forecast at the landing site at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif . \nThe five astronauts , who stowed gear and tested the spacecraft 's steering , said they were unconcerned about the touchy weather expected in the Mojave Desert . \nCommonwealth leaders issued a declaration giving South Africa six months to deliver on pledges to ease apartheid or face new reprisals . \nThe 49-nation organization , meeting in Malaysia , called for tighter financial pressure immediately . \nBritain 's Prime Minister Thatcher alone dissented . \nEast Germany 's leadership vowed swift action to ease travel to the West . \nDespite the pledge by the Communist rulers , tens of thousands of people across the country staged marches over the weekend to demand democratic freedoms . \nIn Leipzig , more than 500 people met with local party officials to discuss internal changes . \nThe Senate convicted federal Judge Alcee Hastings of Miami of eight impeachment articles , removing him from the bench . \nThe chamber voted 69-26 Friday to convict the judge of perjury and bribery conspiracy . \nIt marked the first time a U.S. official was impeached on charges of which a jury had acquitted him . \nRep. Garcia and his wife were found guilty by a federal jury in New York of extorting $ 76,000 from Wedtech Corp. in return for official acts by the New York Democrat . \nThe jury also convicted them of extortion in obtaining a $ 20,000 interest-free loan from an officer of the defunct defense contractor . \nAuthorities in Honduras launched an investigation into the cause of Saturday 's crash of a Honduran jetliner that killed 132 of the 146 people aboard . \nThe Boeing 727 , en route to Honduras from Costa Rica via Nicaragua , smashed into the hills outside Tegucigalpa as it approached the capital 's airport in high winds and low clouds . \nThe U.S. and Israel have been holding what an aide to Prime Minister Shamir called intense telephone negotiations in an effort to bridge differences over Mideast peace moves . \nThe Labor Party , meanwhile , threatened to support a parliamentary motion to topple the coalition unless Shamir showed flexibility on Arab-Israeli talks . \nNicaragua 's Defense Ministry said a group of Contra rebels ambushed two trucks carrying troops in northern Nicaragua , killing 18 of the soldiers . \nThe incident occurred Saturday night . \nThe Sandinista government and the U.S.-backed insurgents agreed in March to suspend offensive operations , but there has been sporadic fighting . \nScientists have isolated a molecule that may hold potential as a treatment for disruptions of the immune system , ranging from organ-transplant rejection , to allergies and asthma , Immunex Corp. said . \nThe molecule is the mouse version of a protein called the interleukin-4 receptor , which directs the growth and function of white blood cells . \nDied : Alfred Hayes , 79 , former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York , Saturday , in New Canaan , Conn . \nContel Corp. said third-quarter net income increased 16 % to $ 72 million , or 45 cents a share , from $ 62 million , or 39 cents a share , as a result of strong growth in telephone-access lines and long-distance minutes of use . \nThe telecommunications company 's results included a one-time gain of $ 4 million , or two cents a share , from the sale of Contel Credit , a leasing and financial-services subsidiary . \nRevenue rose 8.3 % to $ 780 million from $ 720 million . \nTelephone-operations quarterly profit increased 9 % to $ 84 million from $ 77 million , while federal-systems earnings declined 33 % to $ 4 million from $ 6 million . \nInformation systems posted a loss of $ 8 million , compared with a loss of $ 9 million a year earlier . \nCustomer-access lines increased at an annualized rate of about 4 % and minutes of long-distance use rose about 12 % . \nA 10 % gain in operating profit in the quarter was offset by a 21 % boost in interest expense , reflecting higher consolidated borrowings and interest rates . \nIn New York Stock Exchange composite trading , Contel closed at $ 33.75 a share , down .50 cents . \nIn East Germany , where humor has long been the only way to express political criticism , they 're not laughing about their new leader Egon Krenz . \nMr. Krenz is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about him . \n`` You have to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes , '' says an East German mother of two who loves swapping political barbs with her friends . \n`` With Krenz , we just do n't know what to expect . '' \nMr. Krenz does n't seem to be the knee-jerk hardliner many initially thought he was when the 52-year-old Politburo member was selected last week to succeed Erich Honecker . \nBut he does n't appear to be ready to make broad changes either . \nAccording to East Germany 's ADN news agency , Mr. Krenz spoke to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged East Germany could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies . \nAlready last week , Mr. Krenz started overhauling East Germany 's heavily censored and notoriously boring news media . \nOn Thursday , a day after he took office , East German television broke into regular programming to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions for a panel of officials to answer . \nThe regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet-style glasnost . \n`` It was quite a shock , '' says a 43-year-old East German shopkeeper . \n`` For the first time in my life , I was n't sure whether I was listening to our news or West German television . '' \nOther changes , including easing restrictions on travel for East Germans , are expected . \nBut whether such moves can win back the confidence of East Germans , who have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks to demand democratic changes , depends largely on whether they feel they can trust Mr. Krenz . \nAnd that 's a problem . \nMr. Krenz is not only closely identified with his mentor , Mr. Honecker , but also blamed for ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for praising China for sending tanks against student demonstrators . \n`` I hope he grows with the job , '' says Rainer Eppelmann , a Protestant pastor in East Berlin . \n`` The most important thing is that he have a chance . '' \nAlthough Mr. Krenz is dedicated to East Germany 's conservative vein of communism , there is much about his style that sets him apart from his party comrades . \nUnlike Mr. Honecker , who tended to lecture people about socialist values , Mr. Krenz enjoys asking questions . \nIndeed , one of his first actions as leader was to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la Gorbachev . \nHe was later shown on television , fielding questions . \nAt one point , he asked a worker whether he thought East Germans were fleeing the country because of restrictive travel policies . \nThe worker 's tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel . \nPeople have a sense the government is ignoring the real problems in our society . '' \nThe exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies . \nThis same tendency toward openness impressed a group of visiting U.S. congressmen this spring . \nRather than trying to `` lecture us , '' says one congressional aide who attended the two-hour meeting , Mr. Krenz `` wanted to listen . '' \nRep. Ronnie Flippo -LRB- D. , Ala. -RRB- , one of the members of the delegation , says he was particularly impressed by Mr. Krenz 's ready admission that East Germany needed to change . \n`` He 's a very tough man , but one who 's also open to arguments , '' adds an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl . \nBut there 's another side to Mr. Krenz . \nBorn in a Baltic town in an area which is now part of Poland , he has dedicated his life to the party apparatus . \nHe moved quickly through the ranks with the help of his patron , Mr. Honecker , and emerged as the heir apparent . \nBarbara Donovan , an expert on East Germany at Radio Free Europe in Munich , says Mr. Krenz may project a smooth image , but she doubts he 's a true reformer . \nEven if he is , she adds , he appears to have only limited room for maneuver within the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo . \nAgainst this background , the new East German leader must move quickly to shore up his government 's standing . \nThe sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through Poland and Hungary , has plunged the country into its deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 . \n`` He does n't have any honeymoon period , '' says a Western diplomat based in East Berlin . \n`` But if he 's sharp and quick , he has a chance . '' \nThe diplomat adds that Mr. Krenz has several things going for him . \nThe East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations . \nAnd his relative youth could help him project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of Mr. Honecker as an out-of-touch old man . \nFor average East Germans , Mr. Krenz remains a puzzle . \n`` Either he was n't being real in the past , or he is n't being real right now , '' says a 30-year-old East German doctor . \n`` Either way , I have a problem with how quickly he 's changed . '' \nThe doctor was among dozens of people milling through East Berlin 's Gethsemane Church Saturday morning . \nThe walls of the church are covered with leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated with the country 's political opposition . \n`` I have to come here to read the walls , '' says the doctor , `` because it 's information I still ca n't get through the newspapers . '' \nMeanwhile , East Germany 's growing openness may even allow the state-controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor . \nTelevision last week carried a new report on East Berlin 's main wallpaper factory and the need to boost production . \nEast Germans remember a comment a few years ago by Kurt Hager , the government 's top ideologist , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason to change your own . \nHis point was there is no reason for East Germany to copy Soviet-style changes . \n`` It 's hard to know whether it was intended to be funny , '' says the East Berlin shopkeeper , `` But everyone I know laughed about it . \nThe list of laboratories claiming to be producing inexplicable amounts of heat from `` cold fusion '' experiments is slowly growing . \nBut the experiments continue to be plagued by lack of firm evidence that the extra heat is coming from the fusing of hydrogen atoms . \nNew experiments at some of the big national laboratories are still unable to find hints of nuclear fusion reactions , leaving only the finding of tritium in a Texas experiment to support University of Utah chemists ' claim of achieving hydrogen fusion at room temperatures . \nThe latest developments in cold fusion research were presented in 24 reports delivered at the fall meeting here of the Electrochemical Society , the first scientific meeting in five months to hear formal reports on cold fusion experiments . \nThe meeting offered stark evidence of a dramatic fall in scientific interest in cold fusion research . \nOf the 1,300 chemists registered for the society 's weeklong meeting , fewer than 200 sat through the day and a half of cold fusion presentations at week 's end . \nThis was in contrast with the society 's meeting last May , at the height of the controversy , when more than 1,500 scientists , along with scores of reporters and TV crews , crowded into a Los Angeles hotel ballroom for a tumultuous special night session on the subject . \nNeither of the two chemists whose Utah experiments triggered the cold fusion uproar , Martin Fleischmann and B. Stanley Pons , were at the meeting . \nBut some members of an ad hoc expert committee set up by the Department of Energy to evaluate the cold fusion research were in the audience . \nThe committee is to recommend at the end of the month whether DOE should support cold fusion research . \nMost of the two dozen scientists taking the podium reported results with new , more sophisticated variations of the seemingly simple electrolysis-of-water experiments described last March by Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons . \nThe experiments involve encircling a thin rod of palladium metal with a wire of platinum and plunging the two electrodes into `` heavy '' water in which the hydrogen atoms are a doubly heavy form known as deuterium . \nWhen an electric current is applied to the palladium and platinum electrodes , the heavy water did begin to break up , or dissociate . \nOrdinarily the electrolysis , or breakup , of the water would consume almost all of the electrical energy . \nBut Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons said their experiments also produced large amounts of heat . \nThe heat energy plus the energy consumed by the breakup of the water molecules added to far more energy coming out of the apparatus than electrical energy going in , they reported . \nBecause they also detected tritium and indications of nuclear radiation , they asserted that the `` excess '' heat energy must be coming from energy released by the nuclear fusion of deuterium atoms inside the palladium rod . \nAs of last weekend , a dozen labs also have reported measuring `` excess '' heat from similar electrolytic experiments , although amounts of such heat vary widely . \nOne of the seven reports presented here of excess heat production was given by Richard A. Oriani , professor of chemical engineering at the University of Minnesota . \nMr. Oriani said his skepticism of the Utah claims was initially confirmed when his first experiments last spring failed to produce results . \nBut he then borrowed a palladium rod from chemists at Texas A&M who said they were getting excess heat . \n`` The results were fascinating , '' he said . \nOn the fourth `` run '' with the borrowed rod , the experiment began producing excess heat . \nThe experiment was stopped briefly to change an instrument . \nWhen it was restarted , heat output `` really took off '' and produced excess heat for several hours before dying down , he said . \nTypical of other experiments , Mr. Oriani said his experiment was `` very erratic . '' \nIt would go along doing nothing but dissociating the heavy water and then at totally unpredictable times , it would begin producing excess heat for as long as 10 or 11 hours before quieting down . \nThe excess heat was 15 % to 20 % more than the energy involved in the electrolysis of water . \nMr. Oriani said the heat bursts were too large and too long to be explained by the sudden release of energy that might have slowly accumulated during the experiments ' quiescent times , as some scientists have suggested . \n`` There is a reality to the excess energy , '' he said . \nOther scientists said they also were getting sporadic bursts of excess heat lasting several hours at a time . \nThe bursts often occur , they said , after they `` perturbed '' the experiments by raising or lowering the amount of electric current being applied , or switching the current off and on . \nOne chemist privately suggested this hinted that some `` anomalous '' chemical reactions might be producing the heat . \nOne reason questions surround the heat experiments is that they involve unusually meticulous measurements . \nTypically , the input energy ranges from a third of a watt to one watt and the excess energy is measured in tenths of a watt . \nOne exception is a continuing experiment at Stanford University where as much as 10 watts of energy are being put into the electrolytic cells . \nA cell filled with heavy water is producing 1.0 to 1.5 watts more heat than an identical electrolytic cell filled with ordinary water next to it , reported Turgut M. Gur , an associate of materials scientist Robert A. Huggins , head of the Stanford experimental team . \nOne of the few hints the excess heat might be produced by fusion came from brief remarks by chemist John Bockris of Texas A&M University . \nMr. Bockris previously reported getting bursts of excess heat and of detecting increasing amounts of tritium forming in the heavy water . \nHe said that within the past few days , he 's gotten evidence that there is a `` weak correlation '' between the time the heat bursts occur and the production of tritium . \nThere is n't any way to continuously measure the amount of tritium in the heavy water , so it 's been difficult to tell whether the tritium formation is related to the heat bursts or some other phenomenon . \nIncreasingly careful attempts to measure neutrons , which would be strong evidence of fusion reactions , continue to be negative . \nMessrs. Fleischmann and Pons initially reported indirect evidence of neutrons being produced in their experiment but later conceded the measurements were questionable . \nResearchers at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , N.M. , reported they went so far as to take a `` cold fusion '' experiment and three neutron detectors into a tunnel under 300 feet of granite to shield the detectors from cosmic rays . \nA number of times they detected neutrons in one , sometimes two , of the three detectors , but only once during 411 hours of the experiment did they detect a neutron burst in all three detectors -- and they think that was a spurious event . \nShimson Gottesfeld of Los Alamos National Laboratory said researchers there detected a burst of neutrons from an early cold fusion experiment last April but decided not to announce it until they could confirm it . \nIn subsequent experiments , one of two neutron detectors occasionally indicated a burst of neutrons but neutron bursts were never recorded in both detectors at the same time . \nThey concluded the indications of neutrons stemmed from faults in the detectors rather than from the cold fusion experiment . \nAt the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California , new experiments indicated that the lithium added to the heavy water so it will conduct a current can produce previously unsuspected electrical effects on the surface of the palladium rod -- which Messrs. Fleischmann and Pons might have misinterpreted , reported Philip Ross from the California laboratory . \nDow Jones & Co. announced Wall Street Journal advertising rates for 1990 . \nThe rates , which take effect Jan. 2 , include a 4 % increase for national edition advertising . \nThe Journal also will offer expanded volume and frequency discounts . \nThe increase for national edition advertising is less than the inflation rate and compares with a 6.5 % increase in 1989 . \n`` Newsprint and postage prices this year have not gone up , '' said Peter R. Kann , president of Dow Jones . \n`` We have invested in improved editorial quality and expanded our quality audience without substantially increasing our costs . \nFundamental fairness and a sense of responsibility lead us to share operating efficiencies with our customers . '' \nAdvertising rates for the Eastern , Midwest , Western and Southwest editions will increase an average 5.5 % , and rates for localized advertising editions will increase 7.5 % . \nRates for the Wall Street Journal Reports will remain unchanged . \nA one-time noncontract full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal national edition will cost $ 99,385 . \nAdvertising rates for The Wall Street Journal\\/Europe , published in Brussels and printed in the Netherlands and Switzerland , will increase 9 % . \nRates for The Asian Wall Street Journal , published and printed in Hong Kong and also printed in Singapore and Tokyo , will rise 8 % . \nRates for The Asian Wall Street Journal Weekly , published in New York for North American readers , will rise 6 % . \nDow Jones also publishes Barron 's magazine , other periodicals and community newspapers and operates electronic business information services . \nIt owns 67 % of Telerate Inc. , a leading supplier of computerized financial information on global markets . \nReflecting the impact of lower semiconductor prices and cuts in defense spending , Texas Instruments Inc. said third-quarter net income fell 31 % and sales dropped slightly from a year earlier . \nNet fell to $ 65 million , or 67 cents a common share , from $ 93.7 million or $ 1.03 a share , a year ago . \nSales fell 2.5 % to $ 1.54 billion from $ 1.58 billion . \nFor the nine months , the electronics and defense concern had net of $ 255.8 million , or $ 2.70 a share , down 5.6 % from $ 271 million , or $ 3.01 a share , in the year-ago period . \nSales were $ 4.66 billion , up 1.3 % from $ 4.6 billion . \nJerry Junkins , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said sluggish consumer-electronics sales reduced demand for semiconductors . \nThat , coupled with lower semiconductor prices and higher semiconductor-depreciation expense , contributed to the decline in sales and profit . \nIn addition , cost increases related to fixed-price defense contracts and a $ 10 million charge to reduce the work force of Texas Instruments ' defense-electronics division also reduced net . \nHowever , the quarter results included $ 28 million in royalty income from patent licenses , up from $ 21 million in the year-earlier period . \nThe nine months include $ 125 million of royalty income , up from $ 98 million last year . \nMr. Junkins was n't optimistic about the short-term outlook , hinting that further workforce reductions may be needed . \n`` We expect near-term sluggishness in the electronics market , '' he said , `` and we will take ongoing cost-reduction actions as necessary to keep operations aligned with demand . '' \nFurther , he said , an internal reorganization to combine several divisions into the Information Technology Group is expected to affect fourth-quarter results by an undisclosed amount . \nLynch Corp. said its Lynch Telephone Corp. subsidiary completed the acquisition of Western New Mexico Telephone Co. for $ 20 million plus assumption of $ 24 million of debt . \nWestern New Mexico Telephone , Silver City , had net income of $ 1.9 million on revenue of about $ 10 million last year . \nIt is an independent phone company with a service area of 15,000 square miles in southwest New Mexico . \nIt is also a partner in the wireline cellular franchise covering most of western New Mexico . \nThe transaction represents Lynch 's entry into the telephone business . \nThe company , which has interests in television , trucking services , and glass-making and food-processing equipment , said it plans to make other acquisitions in the telephone industry . \nNelson Bunker Hunt 's attempted corner on silver a decade ago is still haunting the market in this metal . \nSilver , now trading around $ 5 an ounce , surged to an all-time peak of $ 50 an ounce in January 1980 from around $ 9 in mid-1979 . \n`` Mr. Hunt 's attempt to squeeze the silver market 10 years ago is still indirectly to blame for today 's market depression , '' says Lesley Edgar , managing director of Sharps Pixley Ltd. , London bullion brokers . \nWhile some 100 million ounces of silver once held by Mr. Hunt and Middle Eastern associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of 1979-80 precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. Edgar says . \nPhotographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions . \nMeanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for 44 % of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes . \nJapanese and U.S. photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say . \nSilver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say . \nEven in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as Treasury bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say . \nAlthough prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets earlier this month and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say . \nSilver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum . \nSome analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in the mid-1970s . \n`` Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says Frederick R. Demler , analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . \nA further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the U.S. , he says . \nScrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from India and the Soviet Union . \nSilver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations Peru and Mexico , Mr. Demler says . \nMeanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen six years in a row , he says . \nJapanese demand grew by 70 % in the first half of this year and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require 4.5 million ounces . \nCompared with huge annual surpluses of more than 100 million ounces in the first half of the 1980s , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. Demler says . \nDespite intermittent rallies in the past few years , improvements in the supply-demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range . \n`` There 's just too much silver around , '' says Tom Butler , an analyst at Samuel Montagu & Co. , a London bullion house . \nA huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of at least 617 million ounces is the market depressant , says Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. in a report . \nThis year alone , inventories at the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped `` by a staggering 46 million to 221 million ounces '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says Rhona O'Connell , London-based precious metals analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton . \n`` Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' Ms. O'Connell says . \nMoreover , while Asian and Middle Eastern investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say . \nInvestors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold , says Urs Seiler , senior vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland . \nYet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he says . \nHowever , dealers caution that any increase would be $ 1 to $ 2 at most . \nLooking ahead to other commodity markets this week : \nLivestock and Meats \nAnalysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading today in the wake of a government quarterly census that found fewer-than-expected cattle on feedlots . \nAfter the close of trading Friday , the Agriculture Department reported that feedlots in the 13 biggest ranch states held 8.06 million cattle on Oct. 1 , down 6 % from that date a year earlier . \nMost analysts had expected the government to report a 4 % decline . \nFeedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef . \nThe government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during the quarter dropped 5 % compared with the year-earlier quarter . \nMany industry analysts had been projecting a 3 % decline in placements for the quarter . \nIn the 1988 quarter , many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches . \nThe number of cattle moving onto feedlots in the recent quarter was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable . \nA shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy . \nThe Agriculture Department also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in the quarter dropped by 5 % from the 1988 quarter , which was in line with projections by analysts . \nEnergy \nFriday 's 44-cent-a-barrel price drop to $ 19.98 in the expiring November contract for West Texas Intermediate crude may well set the tone for trading this week in petroleum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange . \nMost traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board . \nOthers said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions . \nBarring any petroleum-related news events , trading in the days ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong fourth-quarter demand will keep prices firm . \nCopper \nCopper prices fell sharply Friday afternoon . \nFor example , copper for December delivery settled 4.5 cents lower at $ 1.2345 a pound . \nPressure came from several developments including the settlement of two long-term strikes . \nOn Friday , one analyst said , rank-and-file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a three-month strike at the Highland Valley mine in British Columbia . \nIn Mexico , the analyst added , employees at the Cananea mine , who have been out of work since late August when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a 35 % cut in the 3,800-man work force . \nThe mine is expected to return to production in about a week . \nOn Friday , selling dominated the afternoon `` curb '' session in London , which takes place at noon EDT . \nThe premium of cash copper to the three-month forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper . \nLong-term support for the December contract was believed to be at $ 1.25 a pound . \nA technical analyst said there were a number of stop-loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it . \nThat brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading . \n`` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said Ben Hanauer , a copper trader at Rudolph Wolff & Co. , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm . \nBut whether this price break has implications for this week , he said , `` we will know more when the London Metal Exchange copper stock levels are released Monday morning . '' \nAnother analyst said he expected LME inventories to be down by about 15,000 tons when the weekly report is issued . \nBernard Savaiko , senior commodities analyst at PaineWebber Inc. , said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower LME stocks , they perceived a bearish sign . \nHe also noted that the Japanese , who had been buying at prices just above the $ 1.25 level , apparently pulled back from the market on Friday . \nMr. Savaiko said he sees a possibility of the December contract dropping to $ 1.05 a pound . \nHewlett-Packard Co. will announce today a software program that allows computers in a network to speed up computing tasks by sending the tasks to each other . \nCalled Task Broker , the program acts something like an auctioneer among a group of computers wired together . \nIf a machine has a big computing task , Task Broker asks other computers in the network for `` bids '' on the job . \nIt then determines which machine is free to do the task most quickly and sends the task to that machine . \nHewlett-Packard claims that the software allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast . \nThe new Hewlett-Packard program , said analyst John McCarthy at Forrester Research Inc. , a computer-market research company , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . '' \nIn today 's computer networks , some machines often sit idle while others are overtaxed . \nWith the Hewlett-Packard program , he said , `` You get more bang for the buck you 've spent on computers . '' \nThe program , which will be shipped in January 1990 , runs on the Unix operating system . \nHewlett-Packard will charge $ 5,000 for a license covering 10 users . \nThe program now works on all Hewlett-Packard and Apollo workstations and on computers made by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn . \nHewlett-Packard said it will sell versions later next year that run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines . \nThe Task Broker differs from other programs that spread computing tasks around a network . \nA previously available program called Network Computing System , developed by Hewlett-Packard 's Apollo division , for instance , takes a task and splits it up into parts , divvying up those parts to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing . \nBut programs in individual computers must be revised in order to work with that system . \nApplications wo n't have to be rewritten to work with Task Broker , Hewlett-Packard said , and the user of a computer wo n't be able to tell that another machine is doing the work . \nThe Task Broker `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned -- one giant computer , '' said Bill Kay , general manager of Hewlett-Packard 's workstation group . \nPrice wars between the fast-food giants are starting to clobber the fast-food little guys : the franchisees . \n`` When elephants start fighting , ants get killed , '' says Murray Riese , co-owner of National Restaurants , a New York franchisee for Pizza Hut , Roy Rogers and other chains . \nAs hamburger and pizza outlets saturate one area after another , franchisers are struggling desperately for market share , slashing prices and stepping up costly promotions . \nThe fight is putting a tight squeeze on profits of many , threatening to drive the smallest ones out of business and straining relations between the national fast-food chains and their franchisees . \nThe chains `` used to offer discounts during winter when business was slow , but in the last year or so , discounting has become a 12-month thing , '' says Donald Harty , president of Charisma Group Inc. , a New York franchisee of Grand Metropolitan PLC 's Burger King chain . \nThough Charisma 's sales are up slightly this year , Mr. Harty says profits will be flat or lower . \nAnd Bill Konopnicki , a Safford , Ariz. , licensee of McDonald 's Corp. who is chairman of the company 's National Operators Advisory Board , says some fast-food outlets `` could be in serious trouble , based on the amount of discounting that seems to be going on . '' \nUntil recently , the huge fast-food industry , with sales of about $ 60.1 billion last year , kept price-skirmishing to a minimum . \nBut early this year , PepsiCo Inc. 's Taco Bell unit and Wendy 's International Inc. slashed prices and stepped up promotions , says John Rohs , an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Co . \nThat brought a chain reaction in the industry . \nThe situation was further aggravated early this month , when McDonald 's set plans to heat up the discounting by offering coupons . \nIt also decided to go national with pizza , which it has been test-marketing . \nNow , two-for-one deals on pizza are common ; so are 99-cent specials on sandwiches normally priced twice as high . \nThe discounting , say fast-food operators , occurs on a scale and with a frequency they have n't seen before . \nThe result is that some franchisees are running hard just to stay even , laying off middle managers and working harder to make less . \nJoe Mack , a district manager for Cormack Enterprises Inc. , a Burger King operator in Omaha , Neb. , says discounting is so prevalent that `` we have to serve 15 % to 20 % more customers '' to keep sales level . \n`` It 's almost as if you 're doing extra work to give away the food , '' he says . \nAlan D'Agosto , president of Panda 's Inc. , an operator of Arby 's restaurants in Omaha , says : `` All we 're doing is keeping the customers coming , but we are n't increasing sales . '' \nWith fast-food outlets on every corner , he , like many , does n't think he has a choice in the price war : `` Our customers say that they wo n't go into a fast-food store unless they get a coupon . '' \nIf the battle continues much longer , many fast-food businesses will close or merge , predicts Vincent Morrissey , who owns a string of Kentucky Fried Chicken stores in the Midwest . \n`` The industry is overbuilt , '' he says . \n`` Fast-food franchisers have managed to squeeze in stores into every corner available . '' \nThe National Restaurant Association says quick-service restaurant units in the U.S. rose 14 % to 131,146 between 1983 and 1987 , the last year for which figures are available . \nWith the market so crowded , says a spokesman for Wendy 's in Columbus , Ohio , `` If you 're doing well , you 're doing well at someone else 's expense . '' \nSimply put , there is n't enough business for every store to grow . \nAccording to Mr. Rohs , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales at company-owned Wendy 's units in the U.S. have trailed year-earlier levels throughout 1989 , except for August . \n`` McDonald 's has also been running negative all year , '' the analyst says . \nSpokesmen for Wendy 's and McDonald 's criticized Mr. Rohs 's calculations . \nJack Greenberg , executive vice president and chief financial officer of McDonald 's , says the company does n't compute , much less disclose , inflation-adjusted , same-store sales . \nHe adds that short-term comparisons `` can be very misleading because of differences in timing of marketing programs from year to year . '' \nProfit margins at company-owned McDonald 's outlets in the U.S. `` are holding up quite nicely , '' says Mr. Greenberg . \nProfits of franchisees have n't been higher since the mid-1970s , he adds . \nBut Mr. Greenberg 's sanguine outlook is n't matched by many fast-food industry observers . \nSmaller chains and single-store operators will be the first to fail , many in the industry predict . \nBig franchise groups `` can ride out the storm a lot longer , '' says Mr. Harty , the Burger King operator in New York . \nThe prolonged price pressures are driving a wedge between some franchisers and their franchisees . \nMr. Morrissey , the Kentucky Fried Chicken franchisee , notes that most franchise owners must absorb increases in expenses without any cut in the royalties , or portion of sales , that they must pay franchisers . \nFranchisees ca n't be forced to go along with a franchiser 's discounting . \nBut once a franchisee agrees to a promotional program , the franchiser can demand full participation to the very end , says Lew Rudnick , a principal of Rudnick & Wolfe , a Chicago law firm with franchise industry clients . \nHe says courts have held that antitrust considerations are outweighed in such cases by the need to protect consumers from deceptive marketing . \nIn any case , many franchisees , in order to stay on good terms with franchisers , routinely go along with promotions . \nSays Mr. Riese of National Restaurants : `` If you resisted on prices , maybe you would never get that telephone call about a new franchise . \nCompanies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . \nThe companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . \nEstimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . \nThe percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . \nOtherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate . \nCompanies listed below reported quarterly profit substantially different from the average of analysts ' estimates . \nThe companies are followed by at least three analysts , and had a minimum five-cent change in actual earnings per share . \nEstimated and actual results involving losses are omitted . \nThe percent difference compares actual profit with the 30-day estimate where at least three analysts have issues forecasts in the past 30 days . \nOtherwise , actual profit is compared with the 300-day estimate . \nCalMat Co. said it completed a $ 32.8 million sale of assets from its Los Angeles area real estate portfolio for net income of $ 12 million . \nCalMat said the sale is part of its previously announced plan to sell much of its real estate holdings to focus on its core business of mining and producing asphalt , concrete , rock and sand . \nAnd you thought the only reason to save your canceled checks was to prepare for an IRS audit . \nReggie Jackson , the retired baseball star , has found another use for them . \nMr. Jackson , who won the nickname `` Mr. October '' for his World Series exploits , is selling some of his canceled checks to autograph collectors through a dealer for as much as $ 500 each . \nDealers say the budding trade in Mr. Jackson 's canceled checks is unusual . \n`` I do n't know of any living ballplayer that 's ever done it , '' says Jack Smalling , a dealer in Ames , Iowa , and a recognized expert in the field of baseball autographs . \nAn initial batch of Mr. Jackson 's checks was on sale at a baseball-card show held in San Francisco over Labor Day weekend . \nMr. Jackson showed up at the affair to sign autographs for a fee as well . \n`` For someone who has everything else -- Reggie 's jersey , cap and cards -- his checks might be a nice addition , '' says William Vizas , owner of Bill 's Sports Collectibles in Denver , who examined the checks at the San Francisco card show . \nFor years , the canceled checks of a small number of well-known baseball players have been bought and sold . \nBut these players were dead . \n`` Maybe three years ago , there were a lot of -LCB- Ty -RCB- Cobbs in the hobby , and awhile back there were Babe Ruth checks , '' says Mr. Smalling . \nHowever , the thought of a living player selling his checks rubs some people the wrong way . \n`` Maybe I 'm a little stuffy , but I would n't sell them , '' sniffs Bob Machon , owner of Papa 's Sports Cards in Menlo Park , Calif . \n`` Who knows how much they 'll be worth 100 years from now ? '' \nAnd Mr. Smalling does n't believe they 're worth all that much now . \n`` I do n't think the checks are worth $ 15 apiece , '' he says . \nWhy Mr. Jackson , who could n't be reached for comment , has made some of his checks available for sale is n't clear . \nHe probably has n't done it for the cash . \n`` I would say he 's definitely not in need of money , '' says Matt Merola , an agent of Mr. Jackson 's based in New York . \n`` He has good investments . '' \nAnd Mr. Jackson probably has opened new checking accounts , too . \nOr at least he should . \n`` I assume those accounts are closed , '' says Mr. Smalling , referring to the accounts of the canceled checks . \n`` I do n't think he 'd want to give out his current account numbers . \nUSX Corp. and its Japanese partner , Kobe Steel Ltd. , agreed to form a joint venture to build a new plant to produce hot-dipped galvanized sheet products , mainly for the automotive market . \nTerms were n't disclosed for the plant , which will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons . \nThe move by the nation 's largest steelmaker follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies . \nBethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans to build additional lines for such coated corrosion-resistant steel . \nThe surge in production , analysts say , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand . \nThey note that most of the new plants will come on line in 1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends , which could result in more imports . \n`` There 's too much capacity , '' contended Charles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . \n`` I do n't think there 's anyone not building one . '' \nHe does add , however , that transplanted Japanese car makers are boosting the levels of U.S.-made steel in their autos , instead of relying heavily on imported steel . \nThat trend could increase demand for hot-dipped galvanized sheet . \nThe hot-dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest-growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , coveted by all major integrated steelmakers wanting to maintain an edge over smaller minimills and reconstructed mills -- those spun off to employees . \nIndeed , USX said it expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by 1992 , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped in 1988 . \nFor the first eight months of 1989 , analysts say shipments of hot-dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % . \nUSX and Kobe Steel hope to reach a definitive agreement establishing the 50-50 partnership by the end of the year , with construction tentatively slated for the spring of 1990 and production by 1992 . \nUSX already has six lines in existing plants producing hot-dipped galvanized steel , but this marks the first so-called greenfield plant for such production . \nMoreover , it will boost by 50 % USX 's current hot-dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons . \nThe company said it does n't expect the new line 's capacity to adversely affect the company 's existing hot-dipped galvanizing lines . \nSteelmakers have also been adding capacity of so-called electrogalvanized steel , which is another way to make coated corrosion-resistant steel . \nOne of the advantages of the hot-dipped process is that it allows the steel to be covered with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly . \nONCE YOU MAKE UP your mind about an investment , the rest is easy , right ? \nYou just call your broker and say `` buy '' or `` sell . '' \nDream on . \nThere are all sorts of ways to give buy and sell instructions to a broker -- and just as many ways to get burned if you do n't know what you 're doing . \nSo here 's a rundown of the most common types of market orders permitted by the stock and commodity exchanges . \nTwo things to keep in mind : Not all exchanges accept every type of order . \nAnd even when a specific order is acceptable to an exchange , a brokerage firm can refuse to enter it for a customer . \nMarket Order : This is probably the most widely used order -- and the one most open to abuse by unscrupulous floor brokers , since it imposes no price restrictions . \nWith a market order , an investor tells a broker to buy or sell `` at the market . '' \nIt 's like saying , `` get me in now '' or `` get me out now . '' \nFor example , if wheat is being offered at $ 4.065 and bid at $ 4.060 , a market order to buy would be filled at the higher price and a market order to sell at the lower price . \nA recent indictment alleges that some floor brokers at the two largest Chicago commodity exchanges used market orders to fill customers ' orders at unfavorable prices by arranging trades with fellow brokers . \nProfits realized from these trades would then be shared by the conspiring brokers . \nLimit Order : Limit orders are used when investors want to restrict the amount they will receive or pay for an investment . \nInvestors do this by specifying a minimum price at which the investment may be sold or the maximum price that may be paid for it . \nSuppose an investor wants to sell a stock , but not for less than $ 55 . \nA limit order to sell could be entered at that price . \nOne risk : Investors may regret the restriction if the stock reaches 54 and then falls . \nUnless the market goes at least one tick -LRB- the smallest price increment permitted -RRB- beyond the limit price , investors are n't assured of having their orders filled because there may not be sufficient trading volume to permit filling it at the specified price . \nStop Order : Stop orders tell a floor broker to buy or sell an investment once the price reaches a certain level . \nOnce the price reaches that level , a stop order turns into a market order , and the order is filled at whatever price the broker can get . \nStop orders are sometimes called `` stop-loss '' orders because they are frequently used to protect profits or limit losses . \nWhile stop orders sound similar to limit orders , there is a difference : Sell stops must be entered at a price below the current market price and buy stops above . \nIn contrast , sell limit orders must be placed above the market price and buy limit orders are placed below . \nThe crash in October 1987 and last Friday 's sell-off painfully taught some investors exactly what stop orders will and wo n't do . \nAn investor who may have placed a stop-loss order at $ 90 under a stock that was trading at $ 100 a share on the Friday before the crash was stunned to discover that the order was filled at $ 75 when the stock opened at that price on Monday . \nStop-Limit Order : Stop-limit orders turn into limit orders when an investment trades at the price specified in the order . \nUnlike stop orders -- which are filled at the market price when the stop price is hit -- stop-limit orders demand that the trades be made only at the specified price . \nIf it ca n't be made at that price , it does n't get filled . \nInvestors who wish to be out of a position , without the risk of receiving a worse-than-expected price from a market order , may use this type of order to specify the price at which the order must be filled . \nBut if the market moves quickly enough , it may be impossible for the broker to carry out the order because the investment has passed the specified price . \nMarket-If-Touched Order : Market-if-touched orders are like stop orders in that they become market orders if a specified price is reached . \nHowever , unlike a buy-stop order , a buy market-if-touched order is entered at a price below the current price , while a sell market-if-touched order is entered at a price above it . \nAs soon as the market trades at the specified price the floor broker will fill it at the best possible price . \nFill-Or-Kill Order : The fill-or-kill order is one of several associated with the timing of trades . \nIt instructs a broker to buy or sell an investment at the specified price or better . \nBut if the investment ca n't be bought or sold immediately , the order is automatically canceled . \nGregory Bessemer , who came in second in the stock division of the recently completed U.S. Trading Championship , says he uses fill-or-kill orders almost exclusively when trading options . \n`` I like to use them to feel out the market , '' he says . \n`` If they do n't fill it immediately , then I can start over at a new price or try again with the same price . '' \nNot-Held Order : This is another timing order . \nIt is a market order that allows floor brokers to take more time to buy or sell an investment , if they think they can get a better price by waiting . \nNot-held orders , which are also known as `` disregard the tape '' orders , are always done at the customer 's risk . \nOne-Cancels-The-Other Order : This is really two orders in one , generally for the same security or commodity , instructing floor brokers to fill whichever order they can first and then cancel the other order . \nIn a fast-moving market , it prevents an investor from getting stuck with having made two trades on the same security . \nSpecific-Time Order : This type of order couples many of the orders described above with instructions that the order must be carried out at or by a certain time . \n`` On the close '' can be added to many types of orders . \nFor example , `` market-on-close orders '' must be filled during the last few minutes of trading for the day at a price that is within the official closing range of prices as determined by the exchange . \n`` Stop-close-only orders '' are stop orders that only become active during the closing minutes of trading . \n`` Day orders '' expire at the end of the day on which they are entered , `` good-till-canceled orders '' have no expiration date . \nMost brokers assume that all orders are day orders unless specified otherwise . \nOn Oct. 19 , 1987 , some investors learned the consequences of entering `` good-til-canceled limit orders '' and then forgetting about them . \nThey found they had bought stock from limit orders that they might have entered weeks or months earlier and had forgotten to cancel . \nIt is always the responsibility of investors to keep track of the orders they have placed . \nInvestors who change their mind about buying or selling after an order has been filled are , usually , stuck with the consequences . \nMr. Angrist writes on the options and commodities markets for The Wall Street Journal . \nIN SIZING UP the risks of stock-market investments , there 's probably no starting place better than `` beta . '' \nBut investors better not ignore its limitations , either . \nBeta is a handy gauge that measures the volatility of a stock or stock mutual fund . \nFor any given move in the overall market , it suggests how steeply that particular issue might rise or fall . \nBeta figures are widely available and easy to interpret . \nThe beta of the broad market , typically defined as the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , is always 1.0 . \nSo a stock with a beta of 0.5 is half as volatile , one at 1.5 is 50 % more volatile , and so on . \nCautious investors should generally go with stocks that have low betas . \nGo with high-beta stocks to get the biggest payoff from a bet on a bull market . \nRemember , though , that beta also has important limitations . \n`` Beta is only part of the risk in a stock , '' says William F. Sharpe , the Stanford University emeritus professor who developed the measure . \n`` There is risk that is not associated with market moves , and the beta does n't tell you the magnitude of that . '' \nIn particular , beta does n't measure the company - and industry-specific risk associated with an individual stock . \nThat `` business '' risk is very significant for an investor with only a few stocks , but it virtually disappears in a large and well-diversified portfolio . \nBeta is also a poor indicator of the risk in stock groups that march to their own drummer . \nIn particular , the prices of gold and other precious-metals stocks shoot up and down , but the stocks tend to have low betas because their moves are not market-inspired . \nConcern that investors could misinterpret such readings led the American Association of Individual Investors to eliminate beta figures for precious-metals funds in the 1989 edition of its mutual-fund guide . \n`` Our fear was people would look just at the beta -LCB- of a gold fund -RCB- and say here is an investment with very low risk , '' says John Markese , director of research for the Chicago-based group . \n`` In reality it 's very volatile , but the movements are not because of market movements . \nREADY TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ? \nFirst , a pop quiz . \nWhen you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment , '' what 's the specific peril that comes to mind ? \nPencils down . \nIf you 're like most people , you said it 's a holding that goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that defaults or a stock whose value disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding . \n`` People tend to see risk primarily on that one dimension , '' says Timothy Kochis , national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins & Sells . \nBut therein lies another aspect of investment risk : the hazard of shaping your portfolio to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind-sided by others . \nThis is clearly not good news to all you people who sleep like babies every night , lulled by visions of your money sitting risk-free in six-month CDs . \nRisk wears many disguises , and investments that are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds . \nU.S. Treasury bonds , for example , are supersafe when it comes to returning money at maturity . \nBut their value as investments can be decimated by inflation , which erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed-dollar interest payments . \nRisk is also a function of time . \nWhen financial professionals measure risk mathematically , they usually focus on the volatility of short-term returns . \nStocks are much riskier than Treasury bills , for example , because the range in performance from the best years to the worst is much wider . \nThat is usually measured by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time . \nBut investors who are preoccupied with short-term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- not generating enough money to meet long-term financial and life-style goals . \nFor instance , some investors have sworn off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced those feelings . \nBut the stock market , despite some stomach-churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods . \nBy retreating to the apparent security of , say , money-market funds , investors may not be earning enough investment return to pay for a comfortable retirement . \n`` That 's the biggest risk of all -- the risk of not meeting your objectives , '' says Steven B. Enright , a New York financial planner with Seidman Financial Services . \nAs a result , financial advisers say they take several steps when evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios . \nThey estimate the return a person 's current portfolio is likely to generate over time , along with a standard deviation that suggests how much the return will vary year by year . \nThey try to figure out the long-term results the person needs to meet major goals . \nAnd they eyeball types of risk that are not easily quantified . \nThe portfolios of two hypothetical families , one a couple at retirement age and another a two-income couple at age 45 , illustrate several types of risk that investors need to consider . \nFor instance , the insured municipal bonds that dominate the older couple 's portfolio were probably selected in large part for their low repayment risk . \nBut they expose the holders to a lot of inflation risk and interest-rate risk . \nThe younger couple 's stockholdings involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of the money is in a single issue . \nNote that the younger couple 's portfolio has a higher expected annual return , 10.1 % vs. 8.8 % , as calculated by Seidman Financial Services , which is the financial-planning affiliate of BDO Seidman . \nThat largely reflects the heavy stockholdings . \nBut one price paid for the higher expected return is greater short-term volatility , as reflected in the higher standard deviation that Seidman estimates for the younger couple 's portfolio . \n-LRB- Here 's how to interpret a standard deviation figure : Take the expected return and add one standard deviation to it . \nThen take the expected return and subtract one standard deviation . \nIn two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate . \nThen add and subtract two standard deviations to get a wider range . \nThere 's a 95 % probability any year 's result will fall in the range . -RRB- \nOf course , the greater volatility of the younger couple 's portfolio does n't necessarily mean those investments are riskier in terms of meeting the holders ' long-term goals . \nIndeed , the older couple 's portfolio could actually be riskier in that sense if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars to meet their spending plans . \n`` They may feel emotionally secure now because they are not heavily in the stock market , '' says John H. Cammack , a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington . \n`` But they may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . '' \nMs. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . \nWhen it comes to investing , trying to weigh risk and reward can seem like throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver , or the ups and downs that will occur along the way . \nLooking to the past can provide some clues . \nOver several decades , for instance , investors who put up with the stock market 's gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like Treasury bills . \nBut while history can suggest what is reasonable to expect there 's no guarantee that the past will repeat itself . \nFor instance , some analysts believe bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of the stock market . \nAnd returns on cash investments may continue to exceed inflation by a wider margin than they did over the long-term past . \nPortfolio A : Retired couple , age 65 ; $ 400,000 portfolio . \nPortfolio B : Two-income couple , age 45 ; $ 150,000 portfolio . \nA letter from Senator John Kerry chides us today for implying that he had `` flip-flopped '' on Manuel Noriega . \nHe correctly says he has been down on Noriega for some time , hence his criticism of administration mishandling of the attempted coup . \nOur October 12 editorial should have been more precise . \nIt meant to convey our hope that the Senator and other members of the congressional left are broadening their dislike of Noriega to include other notorious Central American drug runners . \nThe Sandinistas of Nicaragua , for example , also are part of the Castro-Medellin cartel nexus . \nIn his letter and on the basis of his losing vote Tuesday against U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan opposition , Senator Kerry makes clear he has not made that intellectual leap . \nWe were wrong . \nTHROUGHOUT THE 1980s , investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning . \nCapital has been democratized , and people want in . \nToo often , however , small investors are left with the same stale solutions that appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists . \nNow a startling new approach is available to building your financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without hurting your life style one bit ! \nThis is particularly good news for those who hate risk , who are incapable of doing extensive amounts of planning and who refuse to see their life styles hurt in any way . \nYou know who you are . \nMy revolutionary system is also useful for those who have tried customary forms of growing their currency cushion . \nLike all Americans seeking chronic prosperity , I do find it necessary to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools , if only to assuage my father-in-law , who believes in such things . \nSo throughout the decade I have maintained my share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as preserving my necessary position in the residential real-estate market . \nReturn on this fine portfolio has been modest when it has not been negative . \nFigure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses I 've invested in during this prosperous decade -LRB- see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 -RRB- . \nOil-related properties suffered a huge decline until I divested myself of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery . \nLikewise , mutual funds remained relatively flat until I made what was , for me , a serious investment . \nBy 1987 , these properties were in a tailspin , causing my broker at Pru-Bache to remark that she 'd `` never seen anything like it . '' \nConcerned for her state of mind , I dropped them -- and the market instantly began its steady climb back to health . \nPerhaps most dramatic was the performance of the metropolitan New York real-estate market , which was booming until I entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years . \nDisgusted , I cast around for a different way to plan my asset distribution , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer struck me : I was doing it already ! \nWe 've all got money to spend , some of it clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it . \nBank it ? \nNot really ! \nSock it away in long-term instruments ? \nNonsense ! \nDaily living is the best possible investment ! \nYour priorities may be different , but here in Figure 2 is where I 've chosen to build for the future : personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all . \nAll have paid off for me in double-digit annual growth and continue to provide significant potential . \nAt least , according to my calculations . \nPersonal space -LRB- Figure 3 -RRB- has grown 35 % annually over the course of the decade , a performance that would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic-leather products for the interiors of cold-weather vehicles , which my cousin got into and sort of regrets to this day . \nThe assortment of expensive children 's toys that I have purchased wisely at a host of discount-toy brokerage firms -LRB- Figure 4 -RRB- has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except , perhaps , for my record collection , whose worth , I think it 's safe to say , is incalculable . \nContinued investment in my 1984 subcompact has been part of my strategy -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB- , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of the car 's original value . \nAccording to my calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of my sedan to more than $ 22,000 on the open market -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- , where I plan to offer it shortly . \nExpansion of my living space has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to its suburban locale . \nI have thus committed sufficient personal outlay to ensure that my grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers . \nMy initial stake in this blooming enterprise has grown tenfold , according to my conservative calculations . \nAt the same time , my share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning . \nOver the course of the decade , for instance , my return on investment in the area of poker alone -LRB- Figures 7A and 7B -RRB- has been most impressive , showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way my associates play -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond . \nWith this personal strategy firmly in place , I look forward to years of fine life-style investments and increasing widespread leverage . \nMy kids ' college education looms as perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending , although I 'll probably have to cash in their toy portfolio to take advantage of it . \nBut with every step I take , I 'm building wealth . \nYou can , too , if you , like me , refuse to bite the bullet . \nSo go out there and eat that debt . \nYou 're right there in the mainstream of American business , building value on the back of insupportable expenditures . \nHenry Kravis , watch out ! \nMr. Schwartz is a business executive and writer in New York . \nWHEN JAMES SCHWARTZ was just a lad his father gave him a piece of career advice . \n`` He told me to choose an area where just by being mediocre I could be great , '' recalls Mr. Schwartz , now 40 . \nHe tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers . \nNow he has settled into a career that fits the bill -- financial planning . \nIt should be noted that Mr. Schwartz , who operates out of Englewood , Colo. , is a puckish sort who likes to give his colleagues the needle . \nBut in this case the needle has a very sharp point . \nThough it 's probably safe to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as one wag puts it , `` anybody who can fog a mirror '' can call himself a financial planner . \nPlanners now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars , but in effect they operate in the dark . \nThere is no effective regulation of planners , no accepted standard for admission into their ranks -- a dog got into one trade group -- no way to assess their performance , no way even to know how many of them there are -LRB- estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000 -RRB- . \nAll anyone need do is hang up a shingle and start planning . \nSo it should come as no shock that the profession , if that 's what it is , has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents seem to be frittering away or flat-out stealing their clients ' money . \nAlarmed , state and federal authorities are trying to devise ways to certify and regulate planners . \nIndustry groups and reputable planners who are members of them want comprehensive standards , too ; they 're tired of seeing practitioners depicted collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine . \nBut reform has n't taken hold yet . \n`` The industry is still pretty much in its Wild West days , '' says Scott Stapf , director of investor education for the North American Securities Administrators Association . \nAn admittedly limited survey by NASAA , whose members are state securities-law regulators , found that between 1986 and 1988 `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million . \nThe rogues ' gallery of planners involved includes some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who scammed his wife 's grandmother . \nWhat 's more , the losses they and the others caused `` are just what we are stumbling over , '' says Mr. Stapf , adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go undetected . \nSo do just about all the losses that could be attributed to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners . \nNobody can estimate the toll , but John Gargan , a Tampa , Fla. , planner and head of one trade group , the International Association of Registered Financial Planners , thinks the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery . \nHis group , like others , wants minimum standards applied to all who call themselves financial planners . \nSurveying all this , some people now think the best planner might be no planner at all . \nFor most investors `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks , '' says Barbara Roper , who follows financial-planning issues for the Consumer Federation of America , a consumer-advocacy organization based in Washington . \nShe concedes that such a position is `` unfair '' to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying the trade , but as a consumer advocate she feels impelled to take it . \nShe says her group used to give tips on selecting planners -- check educational and experience credentials , consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus -- but found that even some people who took these steps `` were still getting ripped off . '' \nThe bad news , however , has n't been bad enough to kill the growing demand for financial planning . \nThe Tax Reform Act of 1986 , which eliminated many tax shelters peddled by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had to make an unplanned exit from the business . \nBut membership in the International Association of Financial Planners -LRB- IAFP -RRB- , the industry 's biggest trade group , is still nearly triple what it was in 1980 , and it 's believed that the ranks of planners who do n't belong to any group have soared as well . \nAn estimated 10 million Americans are now using financial planners , and the pool of capital they influence is enormous . \nA survey of 54,000 of them conducted by the IAFP in April showed that these practitioners alone had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion of their clients ' money in the previous 12 months . \nThe sheer number of planners makes the business extremely difficult , if not impossible , to regulate . \nEven the minority of them who must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission as `` investment advisers '' -- people who are in the business of counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically -- have been enough to swamp the agency 's capacity . \nThe SEC has only about 200 staffers assigned to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in 1980 -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade . \nCurrently , a registered investment adviser can expect an SEC audit only once every 12 years . \nA lot of bad things can happen in 12 years . \n`` It does n't take a rocket scientist to figure out our problem , '' says Kathryn McGrath , director of the SEC 's division of investment management . \nSo the SEC has proposed to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned over to an industry-funded , self-regulatory organization patterned on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which operates in the brokerage business . \nSuch an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who broke the rules . \nThe proposal has set off a lively debate within an industry that was far from united to begin with . \nMr. Schwartz , the puckish planner from Englewood , Colo. , says that allowing the business to police itself would be `` like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . '' \nMr. Gargan , the Tampa planner who heads one trade group , favors simply assessing the industry and giving the money to the SEC to hire more staff . \n-LRB- Mr. Gargan 's views are not greeted with wild enthusiasm over at the IAFP , the major industry organization . \nWhen the IAFP recently assembled other industry groups to discuss common standards that might be applied to planners , Mr. Gargan 's group was excluded . \nThat may be because Mr. Gargan , smarting at what he considered slurs on his membership standards made by the rival group , enrolled his dog , Beauregard , as a member of the IAFP . \nThen he sent the pooch 's picture with the certificate of membership -- it was made out to `` Boris ` Bo ' Regaard '' -- to every newspaper he could think of . -RRB- \nThe states have their own ideas about regulation and certification . \nNASAA , the organization of state securities regulators , is pushing for a model regulatory statute already adopted in eight states . \nIt requires financial planners to register with states , pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest . \nThe most common conflict involves compensation . \nNASAA estimates that nearly 90 % of planners receive some or all of their income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products they recommend . \nThe issue : Is the planner putting his clients into the best investments , or the ones that garner the biggest commissions ? \nIn 1986 the New York attorney general 's office got an order from a state court in Albany shutting down First Meridian Corp. , an Albany financial-planning firm that had invested $ 55 million on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors . \nIn its notice of action , the attorney general said the company had promised to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , the attorney general alleged , the company consistently shoved unwary customers into high-risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos . \nThose investments paid big commissions to First Meridian , payments investors were never told about , the attorney general alleged . \nInvestors were further assured that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted . \nIn practice , the attorney general alleged in an affidavit , if an investor had access to cash `` the chances of being turned down by First Meridian were about as probable as being rejected by the Book-of-the-Month Club . '' \nAnd , the attorney general added , First Meridian 's president , Roger V. Sala , portrayed himself as a `` financial expert '' when his qualifications largely consisted of a high-school diploma , work as a real-estate and insurance salesman , and a stint as supervisor at a highway toll booth . \nFirst Meridian and its officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for the attorney general . \nHarry Manion , Mr. Sala 's attorney , says his client denies any wrongdoing and adds that the attorney general 's contentions about First Meridian 's business practices are incorrect . \nAs for Mr. Sala 's qualifications , `` the snooty attorneys for the state of New York decided Mr. Sala was n't qualified because he did n't have a Harvard degree , '' says Mr. Manion . \nCivil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common . \nTwo such actions , both filed earlier this year in Georgia state court in Atlanta , could be particularly embarrassing to the industry : both name J. Chandler Peterson , an Atlanta financial planner who is a founder and past chairman of the IAFP , as defendant . \nOne suit , filed by more than three dozen investors , charges that Mr. Peterson misused much of the $ 9.7 million put into a limited partnership that he operated and promoted , spending some of it to pay his own legal bills and to invest in other companies in which he had an interest . \nThose companies , in turn , paid Mr. Peterson commissions and fees , the suit alleges . \nThe other suit was filed by two men in a dispute over $ 100,000 investments each says he made with Mr. Peterson as part of an effort to purchase the Bank of Scottsdale in Scottsdale , Ariz . \nOne plaintiff , a doctor , testified in an affidavit that he also gave Mr. Peterson $ 50,000 to join a sort of investment club which essentially gave the physician `` the privilege of making additional investments '' with Mr. Peterson . \nIn affidavits , each plaintiff claims Mr. Peterson promised the bank purchase would be completed by the end of 1988 or the money returned . \nMr. Peterson took the plaintiffs ' and other investors ' money to a meeting of the bank 's directors . \nWearing a business suit and western-style hat and boots , he opened up his briefcase and dumped $ 1 million in cash on a table in front of the directors , says Myron Diebel , the bank 's president . \n`` He said he wanted to show the color of his money , '' recalls Mr. Diebel . \nBank officials , however , showed him the door , and the sale never came off . \nAccording to the suit , Mr. Peterson has yet to return the plaintiffs ' investment . \nThey want it back . \nMr. Peterson declines to comment on specific allegations in the two suits , saying he prefers to save such responses for court . \nBut he does say that all of his activities have been `` entirely proper . '' \nOn the suit by the limited partners , he says he is considering a defamation suit against the plaintiffs . \nThe suit , he adds , `` is almost in the nature of a vendetta by a handful of disgruntled people . '' \nRearding the suit over the bank bid , Mr. Peterson says it is filled with `` inflammatory language and half truths . '' \nHe declines to go into specifics . \nMr. Peterson says the suits against him are less a measure of his work than they are a `` sign of the times '' in which people generally are more prone to sue . \n`` I do n't know anybody in the industry who has n't experienced litigation , '' he says . \nMr. Peterson also says he does n't consider himself a financial planner anymore . \nHe now calls himself an `` investment banker . '' \nIn many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it 's plain that only a modicum of common sense on the part of the investors would have kept them out of harm 's way . \nUsing it , would n't a proessional hesitate to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance to invest witha planner ? \nOther cases go to show that an old saw still applies : If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is . \nCertificates of deposit do n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but that did n't give pause to clients of one Alabama planner . \nNow they 're losers and he 's in jail in Mobile County . \nCDs yielding 40 % are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing `` bank '' in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over by a local gas-station operator -- but investors fell for that one too . \nAnd the Colorado planner who promised to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as $ 100 ? \nNever mind . \nYou already know the answer . \nMr. Emshwiller is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau . \nAt the ritzy Fashion Island Shopping Center , the tanned and elegant ladies of this wealthy Southern California beach community disembark from their Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs for another day of exercising their credit cards . \nThey root among the designer offerings at Neiman-Marcus and Bullocks Wilshire . \nThey stroll through the marble-encased corridors of the Atrium Court . \nThey graze at the Farmers Market , a combination gourmet food court and grocery store , while a pianist accompanies the noon fashion show with a selection of dreamy melodies . \n`` The beautiful look of wool , '' croons the show 's narrator , `` slightly Victorian in its influence ... . '' \nMeanwhile , in the squat office buildings that ring Fashion Island , the odds are good that someone is getting fleeced . \nLaw-enforcement authorities say that at any given time , a host of fraudulent telemarketing operations mingle with the many legitimate businesses here . \n`` They seem to like these industrial parks , '' says Kacy McClelland , a postal inspector who specializes in mail fraud . \n`` We call them fraud farms . '' \nWelcome to that welter of contradictions known as Newport Beach . \nThis city of more than 70,000 is known for sunshine , yachts and rich residents . \nIt is also known as the fraud capital of the U.S. , dubbed by investigators and the media as the `` Cote de Fraud '' . \nHow does a community famous for its high living end up as a haven for low-lifes ? \nClearly , the existence of the former lures the latter . \nThe places renowned for breeding bunco , like the Miami neighborhood known as the `` Maggot Mile '' and Las Vegas 's flashy strip of casinos , invariably offer fast cars , high rollers , glamorous women and lots of sunshine . \nYou do n't hear much about unusual concentrations of fraud in Green Bay or Buffalo . \nCon men hate snow . \nNewport Beach fits the scam artists ' specifications perfectly . \nWhat more could a con man in search of the easy life ask for ? \nNothing seems hard here . \nThe breezes are soft , the waves lap gently and the palm trees sway lazily . \nNightlife is plentiful . \nMoreover , ostentation is appreciated . \nThe median price of homes is $ 547,000 ; more than 9,000 vessels fill what the chamber of commerce calls the nation 's largest pleasure-boat harbor . \n`` Blondes , cocaine and Corvettes , '' mutters Mr. McClelland . \n`` That 's what they 're after . '' \nThe rich image of Newport Beach also helps lend the con artists ' operation an air of respectability . \n`` One reason they use Newport Beach is that it sounds swankier than most addresses , '' says David Katz , a U.S. attorney who , until recently , headed a multi-agency Southern California fraud task force . \n`` Newport Beach is known in Rhode Island for having a lot of rich people . '' \nNo wonder all kinds of big-time scams have flourished here , from phony tax-sheltered Bible sales to crooked car dealers to bogus penny-stock traders . \nBut above all , this is the national headquarters for boiler-room operators , those slick-talking snake-oil salesmen who use the telephone to extract money from the gullible and the greedy and then vanish . \nBecause only a fraction of them are ever prosecuted , nobody really knows how much money bogus telemarketing operators really harvest . \n`` I 've heard that there is $ 40 billion taken in nationwide by boiler rooms every year , '' Mr. McClelland says . \n`` If that 's true , Orange County has to be at least 10 % of that . '' \nAnd most of the truly big scams in Orange County seem to originate in Newport Beach or one of the other well-heeled communities that surround this sliver-like city that hooks around a point of land on the California coast south of Los Angeles . \nIn fact , sophisticated big-bucks boiler-room scams are known generically among law-enforcement types as `` Newport Beach '' operations . \nThat contrasts with the penny-ante sales of things such as pen-and-pencil sets and office supplies that are known as `` Hollywood '' scams . \nNewport Beach telemarketers concentrate on precious metals and oil-leasing deals that typically cost thousands of dollars a shot . \nThe investors range from elderly widows to affluent professionals . \nIn one ingenious recent example of a Newport Beach boiler room , prospective investors in Capital Trust Inc. were allegedly told that their investment in precious metals was insured against losses `` caused by employees due to dishonesty , destruction or disappearance , '' according to an indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in Los Angeles last month . \nThus falsely reassured , investors sent $ 11.4 million to the Newport Beach company , most of which was diverted to unauthorized uses , the indictment charges . \nDouglas Jones , an attorney representing Richard O. Kelly Sr. , the chairman and president of Capital Trust , says his client denies that there was any attempt to defraud investors . \n`` There were some business deals that went bad , '' Mr. Jones says , `` but no intent to defraud . '' \nNewport Beach operations differ from the Hollywood boiler rooms in style as well as in dollars . \nTraditionally , boiler rooms operate on the cheap , since few , if any , customers ever visit their offices . \nIndeed , the name derives from the tendency among telemarketing scammers to rent cheap basement space , near the boiler room . \nBut , says Mr. Katz , the U.S. attorney , `` the interesting thing about Newport Beach operations is that they give themselves the indulgence of beautiful offices , with plush furnishings . \nWhen we go there , it 's quite different from these Hollywood places where the sandwiches are spread out on the table and the people are picking their noses . '' \nThe Newport Beach operators also tend to indulge themselves privately . \nInvestigators cite the case of Matthew Valentine , who is currently serving a six-year sentence at Lompoc Federal Prison for his role in Intech Investment Corp. , which promised investors returns of as much as 625 % on precious metals . \nMr. Valentine , who pleaded guilty to five counts of fraud in federal court in Los Angeles , drove a leased Mercedes and lived in an expensive home on Lido Isle , an island in Newport 's harbor , according to investigators . \nWith the $ 3 million received from investors , he took frequent junkets with friends to exotic locales and leased an expensive BMW for his girlfriend , whom he met at the shop where he got his custom-tailored suits . \n`` It 's amazing the amount of money that goes up their nose , out to the dog track or to the tables in Las Vegas , '' Mr. Katz says . \nAll this talk of boiler rooms and fraud is unnerving to the city 's legitimate business element . \nVincent M Ciavarella , regional manager of Property Management Systems , insists he does n't know of any bogus telemarketers operating in the 1.6 million square feet of office space around Fashion Island that his company leases for Irvine Co. , the owner and developer of the project . \nMr. Ciavarella has rejected a few prospective tenants who provided `` incomplete '' financial information and acknowledges that illegitimate operators `` are not easily detectable . \n'' -LRB- Investigators stress that building owners are victims , too , since boiler rooms often leave without paying rent . -RRB- \nRichard Luehrs , president of the Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce , calls boiler rooms a `` negative we wish we could get rid of . '' \nActually , `` we do n't get much negative publicity about this , '' he insists , `` except for the press who write about it . '' \nMr. Lancaster is deputy chief of The Wall Street Journal 's Dallas bureau . \nYOU WENT to college and thought you got an education . \nNow you discover that you never learned the most important lesson : How to send your kids to college . \nTrue , when you went to college , there was n't that much to learn . \nStick some money in an interest-bearing account and watch it grow . \nNow , investment salesmen say it 's time to take some risks if you want the kind of returns that will buy your toddler a ticket to Prestige U. in 18 years . \nIn short , throw away the passbook and go for the glory . \nThe reason is cost . \nNothing in the annals of tuition readied parents for the 1980s . \nTuitions at private colleges rose 154 % in the 10 years ended in June of this year ; that 's twice the 77 % increase in consumer prices for the same period . \nA year at Harvard now goes for $ 19,395 . \nBy 2007 , when this year 's newborns hit campus , a four-year Ivy League sheepskin will cost $ 300,000 , give or take a few pizzas-with-everything at exam time . \nStanford , MIT and other utmosts will cost no less . \nSo what 's a parent to do ? \nSome investment advisers are suggesting , in effect , a bet on a start-up investment pool -- maybe even on margin . \nOthers prefer deep-discount zero-coupon bonds . \nStill others say , Why not take a chance on a high-octane growth fund ? \n`` You 're not going to make it in a 5 % bank account , '' says James Riepe , director of mutual funds at T. Rowe Price . \nTo get the necessary growth , adds Murray Ruffel , a marketing official at the Financial Programs mutual-fund group , `` you need to go to the stock market . '' \nIn other words , a little volatility never hurt . \nIt never hurt anyone , that is , unless the growth funds do n't grow when you need them to . \nOr the zero-coupon bonds turn out not to have been discounted deeply enough to pay your kid 's tuition . \nThat 's the dilemma for today 's parent . \nAlthough many experts are advising risk , no one has a good answer for you if the risk does n't pay off . \nHelp may be on the way . \nThe antitrust division of the Justice Department is investigating the oddly similar tuition charges and increases among the top schools . \nFear of the price police could help cool things off in the 1990s . \nAnd then there 's always State U . \nBut parents ' craving for a top-rated education for their children is growing like their taste for fancy wheels and vintage wine . \nBelatedly aware of public concern , lawmakers and financial middlemen are working overtime to create and sell college savings and investment schemes . \nTheir message , explicit or implicit , is that a good college will cost so much by whenever you want it that the tried and true wo n't do anymore . \nForget about Treasury bills or a money-market fund . \nThe latest wave of marketing is instructive . \nSeveral outfits -- including the Financial Programs , Franklin , and T. Rowe Price mutual-fund groups and the Edward D. Jones brokerage house -- are advertising `` college planner '' tables and charts that tell you how much you need to put aside regularly . \nThe calculations generally rely on an after-tax rate of return of 8 % annually -- a rate historically obtainable by the individual in only one place , the stock market . \nMost of the mailers are free , but Denver-based Financial Programs sells , for $ 15 , a version customized to the age of the child and the college of choice . \nThe figures are shocking . \nTo build a nest egg that would pay for Stanford when a current first-grader reaches college age , parents would need to set aside $ 773.94 a month -- for 12 years . \nThey can cut this to $ 691.09 a month if the investing keeps up through college . \nAnd they can further reduce the monthly amount if they start saving earlier -- when mother and child come home from the hospital . \nPlugging a cheaper college into the formulas still does n't generate an installment most people can live with . \nUsing a recent average private-school cost of about $ 12,500 a year , T. Rowe Price 's planner prescribes $ 450 monthly if the plan begins when the child is six . \nSince the formula assumes an 8 % before-tax return in a mutual fund , there would also be $ 16,500 in taxes to pay over the 12 years . \nNot everyone is so pessimistic . \n`` People are basically peddling a lot of fear , '' says Arthur Hauptman , a consultant to the American Council on Education in Washington . \nHe takes issue with projections that do n't factor in students ' own contribution , which reduces most parents ' burden substantially . \nStill , he says , `` it 's no bad thing '' if all the marketing prods people into putting aside a little more . \n`` The situation you want to avoid is having somebody not save anything and hope they 'll be able to do it out of current income , '' he says . \n`` That 's crazy . '' \nHis advice : Do n't panic . \nParents , he says , should aim at whatever regular investment sum they can afford . \nHalf the amount that the investment tables suggest might be a good goal , he adds . \nThat way , parents will reduce borrowings and outlays from current income when the time comes to pay tuition . \nMr. Hauptman reckons that the best investment choice is mutual funds because they are managed and over time have nearly kept up with the broad stock averages . \nHe favors either an all-stock fund or a balanced fund that mixes both stocks and bonds . \nIn their anxiety , however , parents and other student benefactors are flocking to new schemes . \nThey have laid out about $ 1 billion for so-called baccalaureate zero-coupon municipal bonds -- so far offered by Connecticut , Illinois , Virginia and eight other states . \nAnd they have bought about $ 500 million in prepaid-tuition plans , offered in Michigan , Florida and Wyoming . \nThe prepaid plans take payment today -- usually at current tuitions or at a slight discount -- for a promise that tuition will be covered tomorrow . \nThe baccalaureate bonds -- tax-free , offered in small denominations and usually containing a provision that they wo n't be called before maturity -- seem to be tailor-made for college savers . \nLike other zeros , they pay all their interest at maturity , meaning that buyers can time things so that their bonds pay off just when Junior graduates from high school . \nTheir compounding effect is also alluring . \nIn June , Virginia sold bonds for $ 268.98 that will pay $ 1,000 in 2009 . \nBut Richard Anderson , head of the Forum for College Financing Alternatives , at Columbia University , a research group partly financed by the federal government , says zeros are particularly ill-suited . \nTheir price falls further than that of other bonds when inflation and interest rates kick up . \nThat wo n't matter if they are held to maturity , but if , for any reason , the parents need to sell them before then , there could be a severe loss of principal . \nHad zeros been available in 1972 and had parents bought a face amount equal to four years ' tuition at the time , aiming for their children 's 1988 enrollment , they would have been left with only enough to pay for two years , Mr. Anderson figures . \nMost other bonds , however , would probably not have fared much better . \nThe prepaid plans may be a good bet , provided the guarantee of future tuition is secure . \nIssuing states generally limit the guarantees to in-state institutions , however , and buyers get refunds without much interest if the children do n't attend the specified schools . \nTwo private groups are seeking Securities and Exchange Commission approval for plans that could be more broadly transferable . \nMr. Anderson wants the prestige colleges to sponsor such a plan . \nThe issue here may be the soundness of the guarantee . \nPrepayments , much like mutual-fund purchases , are pooled for investment . \nSponsors are naturally counting on their ability to keep ahead of tuition inflation with investment returns . \nBut buyers are essentially betting on a start-up investment fund with no track record -- and some have been encouraged to borrow to do so . \nOne problem is that the Internal Revenue Service has decided that the investment earnings and gains of the sponsors ' funds are taxable . \nThe colleges , as educational institutions , had hoped that would n't be the case . \nBased on historical rates of return , Mr. Anderson reckons a 100 % stock portfolio , indexed to the market , would have kept up with tuition and taxes in the 20th century . \nBut sponsors might not pick the stocks that will match the market . \nAnd they 're leaning more toward fixed income , whose returns after tax have trailed tuition increases . \n`` I 'm not sure they 're going to make it work , '' says Mr. Anderson . \nWhat happens if the sponsors do n't have the cash to pay the tuitions ? \nFlorida and Wyoming have backed up their guarantees with the full faith and credit of the state governments , meaning that taxpayers will pick up any slack . \nNot so Michigan . \nIts plan is set up as an independent agency . \nThe state says there 's no worry -- investment returns , combined with fees and the gains from unused plans , will provide all the cash it needs . \nMr. Putka covers education from The Wall Street Journal 's Boston bureau . \nIf you start saving for your child 's eduction on Jan. 1 , 1990 , here 's the monthly sum you will need to invest to pay for four years at Yale , Notre Dame and University of Minnesota . \nFigures assume a 7 % annual rise in tuition , fees , room and board and an 8 % annual investment return . \nNote : These figures are only for mandatory charges and do n't include books , transportation etc . \n\\* For in-state students \nSource : PaineWebber Inc . \nAMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County , Miss. , Allen D. Tharp of Isola was one of the best known and most enterprising . \nHe sold quarter-inch fingerlings to stock other farmers ' ponds , and he bought back one-pound-or-so food-fish that he `` live-hauled '' to market along with his own whiskery crop . \nAnd he nearly always bought and sold for cash . \nAlong the way , Mr. Tharp omitted a total of $ 1.5 million from his receipts reported on federal tax returns for three years . \nThe returns landed in the hands of an Internal Revenue Service criminal investigator , Samuel James Baker . \nMr. Baker interviewed or wrote to hundreds of catfish farmers , live-haulers and processors throughout the South before coming up with detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by Mr. Tharp and others . \nUnknown to Mr. Tharp , he had fouled his net on a special IRS project to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined to cheat on their taxes . \nConfronted with the evidence , Mr. Tharp pleaded guilty to one charge of filing a false return and was fined $ 5,000 and sentenced to 18 months in prison . \nHe also owes a lot of back taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties . \nA lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think . \nFederal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation , on the basis of occupation , high income , type of income , or some other characteristic that may signal an opportunity or tendency to hide income or exaggerate deductions . \nMany professions long have seemed to be targets because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts of some members to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : dentists who invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who raised racehorses on their days off . \nMail-order ministers have been squelched . \nNow , television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny . \nThe IRS recently won part of its long-running battle with the Church of Scientology over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that members ' payments to the church were n't deductible because the members received services in return . \nIRS statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used-car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners . \nSmall businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income , the IRS has said . \nOnce such abuses become so pervasive , the IRS builds another factor into its secret computer formula for selecting returns for audit and does n't need special projects for them . \nSan Franciscans have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of them score high under that formula , not because IRS agents envy their life styles . \nMany openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices , have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws to close them . \nDeductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied by appraisals . \nAnd laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled the IRS to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form-letter inquiries to taxpayers . \nUnreported alimony income can be spotted by computer because a payer of alimony -LRB- who gets a deduction -RRB- must report the former spouse 's Social Security number . \nPassport applicants now must give Social Security numbers , enabling the IRS to see whether Americans living abroad are filing required U.S. returns . \nBut while IRS computers focus routinely on target groups like these , the agency has assigned many agents to special projects that need more personal attention . \nIn most cases , the IRS says , these projects are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses . \nThe national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to Marshall V. Washburn , deputy assistant commissioner for examination . \nAuditors involved in noncriminal projects ca n't send anyone to jail , but they can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure to file a return , and the like . \nThe targeted audit groups include direct sellers -- people who sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties -- and employers who label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes . \nOther projects look for offenders among waiters who get cash tips , people who engage in large cash transactions , and people whose returns show they sold a home for a profit without reinvesting the capital gain in another home by the end of the same year ; the gain must be rolled over within two years to defer tax . \nAnd now that returns must show dependents ' Social Security numbers , the IRS wants to see which dependents show up on more than one return -- and which dependents turn out to be deceased . \nImpetus for the direct-seller project came from a congressional hearing some years back . \nIt prompted an IRS study that found many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs , Mr. Washburn says . \nThe study provided criteria for singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who report low income and large expenses from a part-time business . \nThe Tax Court recently denied business deductions by Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who both were part-time distributors of Amway products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields . \nFor 1984 , they reported gross income of $ 1,647 from Amway sales , offset by expenses totaling $ 16,746 -- including car costs of $ 6,805 and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 . \nThe Tax Court did n't believe that the Rubins , who earned $ 65,619 in their regular jobs , treated the sideline as a real business and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from it . \nThe Direct Selling Association , a trade group , points out that its members , which include Amway Corp. , cooperate with the IRS to distribute tax-compliance material to sales people and are helping to prepare a public-service television program on the subject . \nThe independent-contractor project , which began in 1988 , involves about 350 IRS agents . \nIn the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports Raymond P. Keenan , assistant commissioner for collection , they examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self-employed contractors . \nThe number of misclassified workers may be in the millions , mostly paid by small firms . \nMany workers , especially professionals , want to remain independent to avoid tax withholding and to continue to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't . \nBut many others , who want to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for the IRS , says Jerry Lackey , who manages the IRS project 's force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando . \nFirms that are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that are n't , he says . \nIn his area , Mr. Lackey continues , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work . \nBut a medical clinic with about 20 employees wrongly listed all of them -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors . \nThe IRS assessed the clinic $ 350,000 in back payroll taxes . \nIt assessed nearly $ 500,000 against a cruise-ship company that carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self-employed independents . \nRevenue-short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of tax delinquents , and perhaps none tracks them down with more relish than does New York since it acquired an $ 80 million computer system in 1985 . \nThe state 's tax enforcers have amassed data bases from other New York agencies that license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with the IRS , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages . \nThus armed for massive matching of documents by computer , they single out high-income groups , looking primarily for people who have n't filed New York income-tax returns . \nThe state has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of the state , and homeowners who claim to be residents of other states -- especially Florida , which has no personal income tax . \nSoon to feel the glare of attention are lawyers elsewhere in the state , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says Frederick G. Hicks , director of the tax-department division that develops the computer-matching programs . \nThe department has collected over $ 6.5 million from brokers so far and recommended more than 30 of them for criminal prosecution . \nIn the early stage of checking people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 who were filing nonresident returns , it squeezed $ 7.5 million out of a man who was posing as a Florida resident . \n`` We think we can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through the nonresident project , '' Mr. Hicks declares . \nMr. Schmedel is editor of The Wall Street Journal 's Tax Report column . \nIn finding `` good news '' in Berkeley 's new freshman admissions plan -LRB- `` The Privileged Class , '' editorial , Sept. 20 -RRB- , you 're reading the headline but not the story . \nThe plan indeed raises from 40 % to 50 % the number of freshmen applicants admitted strictly by academic criteria . \nBut that does n't mean `` half of the students attending Berkeley '' will be admitted this way . \nThe plan is talking about applicants admitted , not students who enroll . \nSince the `` yield '' from this top slice of applicants is relatively low , boosting admits from 40 % to 50 % will boost registrants from about 31 % to 38 % of the class . \nIn addition , perhaps 5 % of registrants will come from a new category consisting of applicants whose academic credentials `` narrowly missed '' gaining them admission in the first category . \nBut against that combined increase of 12 % in students chosen by academic criteria , the plan eliminates a large category in which admissions now are based on grades , test scores and `` supplemental points '' for factors such as high-school curriculum , English-language proficiency and an essay . \nThis category now accounts for about 19 % of admits and 22 % of registrants . \nThe plan thus will decrease by 22 % , for a net loss of 10 % , the number of students admitted primarily by academic criteria . \nWho will take over these places ? \nThe plan creates a new category of students from `` socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds , '' a concept not yet defined , and gives them about 10 % of the class . \nOne of the plan 's authors has defended the `` socioeconomic disadvantage '' category as perhaps making more sense than the current affirmative-action preferences based on race . \nPerhaps it does . \nBut the new category does not replace or reduce Berkeley 's broad racial preferences . \nNor will students from racial-minority groups who are admitted through the new category be counted against the affirmative-action `` target '' for their group . \nThe plan thus places a large new affirmative-action program , based on `` socioeconomic disadvantage , '' on top of the existing program based on race . \nThe role of academic criteria in choosing Berkeley 's freshmen can only decline as a result . \nStephen R. Barnett Professor of Law University of California Berkeley , Calif . \nFOR THOSE WHO DELIGHT in the misfortune of others , read on . \nThis is a story about suckers . \nMost of us know a sucker . \nMany of us are suckers . \nBut what we may not know is just what makes somebody a sucker . \nWhat makes people blurt out their credit-card numbers to a caller they 've never heard of ? \nDo they really believe that the number is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to being a grand-prize winner ? \nWhat makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door ? \nOr an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that will knock your socks off , once it is built ? \nBecause in the end , these people always wind up asking themselves the same question : `` How could I be so stupid ? '' \nThere are , unfortunately , plenty of answers to that question -- and scam artists know all of them . \n`` These people are very skilled at finding out what makes a person tick , '' says Kent Neal , chief of the economic-crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , a major haven for boiler rooms . \n`` Once they size them up , then they know what buttons to push . '' \nJohn Blodgett agrees -- and he ought to know . \nHe used to be a boiler-room salesman , peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins . \n`` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities you pitch different ways , '' he says . \nThe most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns . \n`` We 're all a little greedy . \nEveryone is vulnerable , '' says Charles Harper , associate regional administrator for the Securities and Exchange Commission in Miami . \n`` These guys prey on human frailties . '' \nWhile the promises of big profits ought to set off warning bells , they often do n't , in part because get-rich-quick tales have become embedded in American folklore . \n`` The overnight success story is part of our culture , and our society puts an emphasis on it with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says Michael Cunningham , an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville . \n`` Other",

            "message": "ease implemented last April . \nThe carriers were competing fiercely for market share . \nRailroad-rate increases are likely to be restrained by weakening rail-traffic levels and keen competition for freight from trucks . \nAn official at Consolidated Freightways Inc. , a Menlo Park , Calif. , less-than-truckload carrier , said rate discounting in that industry has begun to `` stabilize . '' \nConsolidated Freightways plans to raise its rates 5.3 % late this year or early next year , and at least two competitors have announced similar increases . \nTruckers are `` trying to send signals that they need to stop the bloodletting , forget about market share and go for higher rates , '' said Michael Lloyd , an analyst at Salomon Bros . \nAnd `` shippers are getting the feeling that they have played one trucker off against another as much as they can , '' he said . \nAir-freight carriers raised their rates for U.S. products going across the Pacific to Asia by about 20 % earlier this month . \nAnd Japan Air Lines said it plans to boost its rates a further 25 % over the next two years . \nSuch rate increases `` will increase the total cost of U.S. products and slow down the rate of increase of U.S. exports , '' said Richard Connors , a senior vice president of Yusen Air & Sea Service U.S.A. Inc. , the U.S. air-freight-forwarding subsidiary of Nippon Yusen Kaisha of Japan . \nShip companies carrying bulk commodities , such as oil , grain , coal and iron ore , have been able to increase their rates in the last couple of years . \nSome bulk shipping rates have increased `` 3 % to 4 % in the past few months , '' said Salomon 's Mr. Lloyd . \nAnd ship lines carrying containers are also trying to raise their rates . \nCarriers boosted rates more than 10 % in the North Atlantic between the U.S. and Europe last September , hoping to partly restore rates to earlier levels . \nShip lines operating in the Pacific plan to raise rates on containers carrying U.S. exports to Asia about 10 % , effective next April . \nMGM Grand Inc. said it filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a public offering of six million common shares . \nThe Beverly Hills , Calif.-based company said it would have 26.9 million common shares outstanding after the offering . \nThe hotel and Gaming company said Merrill Lynch Capital Markets will lead the underwriters . \nProceeds from the sale will be used for remodeling and refurbishing projects , as well as for the planned MGM Grand hotel\\/casino and theme park . \nBob Stone stewed over a letter from his manager putting him on probation for insubordination . \nMr. Stone thought the discipline was unfair ; he believed that his manager wanted to get rid of him for personal reasons . \nUnable to persuade the manager to change his decision , he went to a `` company court '' for a hearing . \nAt the scheduled time , Mr. Stone entered a conference room in a building near where he worked . \nAfter the three members of the court introduced themselves , the chairman of the panel said : `` Go ahead and tell us what happened . \nWe may ask questions as you go along , or we may wait until the end . '' \nNo lawyers or tape recorders were present . \nThe only extra people were a couple of personnel specialists , one of whom knew Mr. Stone 's case intimately and would help fill in any facts needed to give the court the full picture . \nOver a cup of coffee , Mr. Stone told his story . \nHe talked about 20 minutes . \nWhen he was through , the court members asked many questions , then the chairman said they would like to hear his manager 's side and talk to witnesses . \nThe chairman promised Mr. Stone a decision within two weeks . \nBob Stone is a fictional name , but the incident described is real . \nIt happened at Northrop Corp. in Los Angeles . \nThe court is called the Management Appeals Committee , or just `` MAC , '' and it is likely to hear a couple of dozen cases a year . \nAlter some details of this example and it could be taking place today at Federal Express in Memphis , the Defense and Underseas Systems divisions of Honeywell in Minneapolis , a General Electric plant in Columbia , Md. , or a number of other companies . \nThese firms are pioneers in a significant new trend in the corporate world : the rise of what I call corporate due process . \nAlthough corporate due process is practiced today in few companies -- perhaps 40 to 60 -- it is one of the fastest developing trends in industry . \nIn the coming decade a majority of people-oriented companies are likely to adopt it . \nCorporate due process appeals to management for a variety of reasons . \nIt reduces lawsuits from disgruntled employees and ex-employees , with all that means for reduced legal costs and better public relations . \nIt helps to keep out unions . \nIt increases employee commitment to the company , with all that means for efficiency and quality control . \nWhat must your management team do to establish corporate due process ? \nHere are four key steps : \n1 . Make sure you have a strong personnel department . \nIt must be able to handle most of the complaints that can not be solved in the trenches by managers and their subordinates , else the company court or adjudicators will be inundated with cases . \nAt Polaroid , the Personnel Policy Planning Committee may hear only about 20 cases a year ; the rest of the many hundreds of complaints are resolved at earlier stages . \nAt TWA , the System Board of Adjustment hears 50 to 75 cases a year , only a fraction of the complaints brought to personnel specialists . \nAt Citicorp , the Problem Review Board may hear only 12 or so cases because of personnel 's skill in complaint-resolution . \nIn a typical year , up to 20 % of the work force goes to personnel specialists with complaints of unfair treatment . \nIn a large company that means many hundreds of complaints for personnel to handle . \n2 . Formally or informally , train all your managers and supervisors in the company 's due-process approach . \nSee that they know company personnel policy backwards and forwards , for it is the `` law '' governing company courts and adjudicators . \nCoach them in handling complaints so that they can resolve problems immediately . \nIn case managers and personnel specialists are unsuccessful and subordinates take their complaints to a company court or adjudicator , teach managers to accept reversals as a fact of business life , for in a good due-process system they are bound to happen . \nIn the 15 companies I studied , reversal rates range on the average from 20 % to 40 % . \n3 . Decide whether you want a panel system or a single adjudicator . \nA panel system like that in the Bob Stone example enjoys such advantages as high credibility and , for the panelists , mutual support . \nAn adjudicator system -- that is , an investigator who acts first as a fact-finder and then switches hats and arbitrates the facts -- has such advantages as speed , flexibility and maximum privacy . \nInternational Business Machines and Bank of America are among the companies using the single-adjudicator approach . \n4 . Make your due-process system visible . \nIt wo n't do any good for anybody unless employees know about it . \nMost managements hesitate to go all out in advertising their due-process systems for fear of encouraging cranks and chronic soreheads to file complaints . \nOn the other hand , they make sure at a minimum that their systems are described in their employee handbooks and talked up by personnel specialists . \nSmith-Kline Beecham goes further and sometimes features its grievance procedure in closed-circuit TV programs . \nNaturally , one of the best ways to guarantee visibility for your due-process system is for top management to support it . \nAt IBM , the company 's Open Door system is sometimes the subject of memorandums from the chief executive . \nFederal Express goes further in this respect than any company I know of with both Frederick Smith and James Barksdale , chief executive and chief operating officer , respectively , sitting in on the Appeals Board almost every Tuesday to decide cases . \nMr. Ewing is a consultant based in Winchester , Mass. , and author of `` Justice on the Job : Resolving Grievances in the Nonunion Workplace '' -LRB- Harvard Business School Press , 1989 -RRB- . \nTokyo stocks closed higher in active trading Friday , marking the fourth consecutive daily gain since Monday 's sharp fall . \nLondon shares closed moderately lower in thin trading . \nAt Tokyo , the Nikkei index of 225 selected issues was up 112.16 points to 35486.38 . \nThe index advanced 266.66 points Thursday . \nIn early trading in Tokyo Monday , the Nikkei index rose 101.98 points to 35588.36 . \nFriday 's volume on the First Section was estimated at one billion shares , up from 862 million Thursday . \nWinners outpaced losers , 572 to 368 , while 181 issues remained unchanged . \nWith investors relieved at the overnight gain in New York stocks , small-lot buying orders streamed into the market from early morning , making traders believe the market was back to normal . \nThe Nikkei , which reached as high as 35611.38 right after the opening , surrendered part of its early advance toward the end of the day because of profit-taking . \n`` Investors , especially dealers , do n't want to hold a position over the weekend , '' a trader at Dai-ichi Securities said , adding , though , that the trading mood remained positive through the afternoon session . \nThe Tokyo Stock Price Index -LRB- Topix -RRB- of all issues listed in the First Section , which gained 22.78 points Thursday , was up 14.06 points , or 0.53 % , at 2679.72 . \nThe Second Section index , which rose 15.72 points Thursday , was up 11.88 points , or 0.32 % , to close at 3717.46 . \nVolume in the second section was estimated at 30 million shares , up from 28 million Thursday . \nIn turmoil caused by the previous Friday 's plunge in New York stocks , the Nikkei marked a sharp 647.33-point fall Monday ",

            "message": " people are making it overnight , and the rest who toil daily do n't want to miss that opportunity when it seems to come along . '' \nAdds Spencer Barasch , branch chief for enforcement at the SEC in Fort Worth , Texas : `` Why do people play the lottery when the odds are great against them ? \nPeople are shooting for a dream . '' \nClearly , though , scam artists have to be a bit more subtle than simply promising millions ; the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy . \nThere 's also , for instance , the need to be part of the in-crowd . \nSo one popular ploy is to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that is about to make a killing . \nBetween 1978 and 1987 , for instance , SH Oil in Winter Haven , Fla. , sold interests in oil wells to a very select group of local residents , while turning away numerous other eager investors . \nThe owner of the company , Stephen Smith , who has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges , confided to investors that he had a secret agreement with Amoco Oil Co. and said the location of his wells was confidential , according to a civil suit filed in a Florida state court by the Florida comptroller 's office . \nNeither the Amoco agreement nor the wells existed , the suit alleged . \nSuch schemes , says Tony Adamski , chief of the financial-crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C. , appeal to investors ' `` desire to believe this is really true and that they are part of a chosen group being given this opportunity . '' \nAt times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment the person is being included in , '' says Mr. Cunningham . \nIn appealing to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , the fraud artist can insist that a person keep an investment secret -- insulating himself from being discovered and keeping his victim from consulting with others . \nIt also adds to the mystery of the venture . \nMr. Blodgett , the boiler-room veteran , believes that for many investors , the get-rich-quick scams carry a longed-for element of excitement . \n`` Once people got into it , I was allowing them to live a dream , '' he says . \nHe phoned them with updates on the investment , such as `` funny things that happened at the well that week , '' he says . \n`` You gave them some excitement that they did n't have in their lives . '' \n-LRB- Mr. Blodgett , who was convicted in Florida state court of selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use of the telephone to defraud and deceive , is now on probation . \nHe says he has quit the business and is back in school , majoring in psychology with aspirations to go into industrial psychology . -RRB- \nFor some investors , it 's the appearances that leave them deceived . \n`` The trappings of success go a long way -- wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says Paul Andreassen , an associate professor of psychology at Harvard . \nConservative appearances make people think it 's a conservative investment . \n`` People honestly lose money on risky investments that they did n't realize were a crapshoot , '' he says . \nPaul Wenz , a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney , says a promise of unrealistic returns would have made him leery . \nBut Mr. Wenz , who says he lost $ 43,000 in one precious-metals deal and $ 39,000 in another , says a salesman `` used a business-venture approach '' with him , sending investment literature , a contract limiting the firm 's liability , and an insurance policy . \nWhen he visited the company 's office , he says , it had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . '' \nStill others are stung by a desire to do both well and good , says Douglas Watson , commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko-forgery division . \nBorn-again Christians are the most visible targets of unscrupulous do-gooder investment pitches . \nBut hardly the only ones : The scams promise -- among other things -- to help save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children . \nPsychologists say isolated people who do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud . \nScam artists seek out such people -- or try to make sure that their victims isolate themselves . \nFor instance , salesmen may counter a man 's objection that he wants to discuss an investment with his wife by asking , `` Who wears the pants in your family ? '' \nOr an investor who wants his accountant 's advice may be told , `` You seem like a guy who can make up his own mind . '' \nOften con artists will try to disarm their victims by emphasizing similarities between them . \nWilliam Lynes , a retired engineer from Lockheed Corp. , says he and his wife , Lily , warmed to the investment pitches of a penny-stock peddler from Stuart-James Co. in Atlanta after the broker told them he , too , had once worked with Lockheed . \nThe Lyneses , of Powder Springs , Ga. , have filed suit in Georgia state court against Stuart James , alleging fraud . \nThey are awaiting an arbitration proceeding . \nThey say the broker took them out for lunch frequently . \nHe urged them to refer their friends , who also lost money . \n-LRB- Donald Trinen , an attorney for the penny-brokerage firm , denies the fraud allegations and says the Lyneses were fully apprised that they were pursuing a high-risk investment . -RRB- \n`` It 's not uncommon for these guys to send pictures of themselves or their families to ingratiate themselves to their clients , '' says Terree Bowers , chief of the major-frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in Los Angeles . \n`` We 've seen cases where salesmen will affect the accent of the region of the country they are calling . \nAnything to make a sale . '' \nExperts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point , timing is crucial . \nPeople may be particularly vulnerable to flim-flam pitches when they are in the midst of a major upheaval in their lives . \n`` Sometimes when people are making big changes , retiring from their jobs , moving to a new area , they lose their bearings , '' says Maury Elvekrog , a licensed psychologist who is now an investment adviser and principal in Seger-Elvekrog Inc. , a Birmingham , Mich. , investment-counseling firm . \n`` They may be susceptible to some song and dance if it hits them at the right time . '' \nThey are obviously also more susceptible when they need money - retirees , for instance , trying to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how to pay for a child 's college expenses . \n`` These people are n't necessarily stupid or naive . \nAlmost all of us in comparable circumstances might be victimized in some way , '' says Jerald Jellison , a psychology professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles . \nNick Cortese thinks that 's what happened to him . \nMr. Cortese , a 33-year-old Delta Air Lines engineer , invested some $ 2,000 in penny stocks through a broker who promised quick returns . \n`` We were saving up to buy a house , and my wife was pregnant , '' says Mr. Cortese . \n`` It was just before the Christmas holidays , and I figured we could use some extra cash . '' \nThe investment is worth about $ 130 today . \n`` Maybe it was just a vulnerable time , '' says Mr. Cortese . \n`` Maybe the next day or even an hour later , I would n't have done it . '' \nMs. Brannigan is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Atlanta bureau . \nPrices for seats on the New York Stock Exchange are recovering a bit after hitting a four-year low earlier this month . \nTwo seats on the Big Board were sold yesterday for $ 455,000 , and then $ 500,000 . \nThe previous sale was $ 436,000 on Oct. 17 ; the last time prices were that low was November 1985 , when a seat sold for $ 425,000 . \nPrices peaked at $ 1,150,000 in September 1987 . \nSeats are currently quoted at $ 430,000 bid and $ 525,000 asked . \nFOX HUNTING HAS been defined as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible , but at least it 's exercise . \nAt least it has a little dash . \nMost of us have to spend our time on pursuits that afford neither , drab duties rather than pleasures . \nLike trying to buy life insurance , for instance , an endeavor notably lacking in dash . \nCall it the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible . \nBut sooner or later , most of us have to think about life insurance , just as we often have to think about having root-canal work . \nAnd my time has come . \nI 'm 33 , married , no children , and employed in writing stories like this one . \nIn times past , life-insurance salesmen targeted heads of household , meaning men , but ours is a two-income family and accustomed to it . \nSo if anything happened to me , I 'd want to leave behind enough so that my 33-year-old husband would be able to pay off the mortgage and some other debts -LRB- though not , I admit , enough to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury -RRB- . \nFiguring that maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 would do but having no idea of what kind of policy I wanted , I looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish . \nOver the past decade or two , while I was thinking about fox hunting , the insurance industry has spawned an incredible number of products , variations on products , and variations on the variations . \nBesides term life and whole life -LRB- the old standbys -RRB- , we now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on . \nWhat to do ? \nFirst , generalize . \nShorn of all their riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , insurance policies can still be grouped under two broad categories : so-called pure insurance , which amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death , and permanent insurance , which provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that can be used in various ways while the insured is still alive . \nIf all you want is death-benefit coverage , pure insurance -- a term policy -- gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits . \nIt 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought at the same age . \nBut `` term '' means just that ; the policy is written for a specific time period only and must be renewed when it expires . \nIt may also stipulate that the insured must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if you flunk -- which means you need insurance more than ever -- you may not be able to buy it . \nEven if you 're healthy and can renew , your premium will go up sharply because you 're that much older . \nSo term insurance may not be as cheap as it looks . \nThere are all sorts of variations on term insurance : policies structured to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others . \nOne variation that appealed to me at first was the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered by Amex Life Insurance Co. , the American Express unit , to the parent company 's credit-card holders . \nUpon examination , however , I wondered whether the plan made a lot of sense . \nAmex said it would charge me $ 576 a year for $ 100,000 of coverage -- and would pay me back all the premiums I put in if I canceled the policy after 10 years . \nSounds great -- or does it ? \nFirst , if I canceled , I 'd have no more insurance , a not insignificant consideration . \nSecond , the $ 5,760 I 'd get back would be much diminished in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; Amex , not I , would get the benefit of the investment income on my money , income that would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given the company a real profit . \nThird and most important , Amex would charge me a far higher premium than other reputable companies would on a straight term policy for the same amount ; I 'd be paying so heavily just to have the option of getting my premiums back that I 'd almost have to cancel to make the whole thing worthwhile . \nThat would be all right with Amex , which could then lock in its investment profit , but it does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for me . \nWhich goes to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing . \nAnd the Second Law , unique to insurance ? \nIf I die early , I win -- a hollow victory , since I ca n't enjoy it -- and if I live long , the insurer wins . \nAlways . \nThis is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that amasses cash value . \nThe word `` death '' can not be escaped entirely by the industry , but salesmen dodge it wherever possible or cloak it in euphemisms , preferring to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead . \nThe implication is that your permanent-insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual-fund account with an added feature . \nThat is gilding the lily . \nThe fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally runs a poor second to any direct investment you might make in the same things the insurance company is putting your money into . \nThat 's because you have to pay for the insurance portion of the policy and the effort required to sell and service the whole package . \nAgain , no free lunch . \nThis is reflected in a built-in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of the company 's estimated liability in paying off beneficiaries of people who had the effrontery to die while under its protection . \nAnd in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of the the policy is , in effect , paying the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of this . \nSo view permanent insurance for what it is -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment . \nThe simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy . \nYou pay a set premium for a set amount of coverage , the company invests that premium in a portfolio of its choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years . \nOne newer wrinkle , so called single-premium life -LRB- you pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; the insured could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of the proceeds were taxable even though they included gains on investment . \nCongress closed this loophole last year , or thought it did . \nHowever , Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield , Mass. , has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that it says does not violate the new regulations and that allows policy loans without tax consequences . \nBut the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow tax-free is very small . \nI 'm not prepared in any case to put that much money into a policy immediately , so I look into the broad category called universal life . \nHugely popular , it is far more flexible than straight whole life . \nI can adjust the amount of insurance I want against the amount going into investment ; I can pay more or less than the so-called target premium in a given year ; and I can even skip payments if my cash reserves are enough to cover the insurance portion of the policy . \nIn looking at these and other policies , I learn to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built into `` policy illustrations '' -- the rows of numbers that show me the buildup of my cash values over the years . \nThey commonly give two scenarios : One is based on interest rates that the company guarantees -LRB- usually 4 % to 4.5 % -RRB- and the other on the rate it is currently getting on investment , often 8.5 % or more . \nProjecting the latter over several decades , I find my cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for that long ? \nNot likely , I think . \nAlso , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that I will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year . \nThese are not certain , either . \nCompanies `` are n't comfortable playing these games , but they realize they 're under pressure to make their policies look good , '' says Timothy Pfiefer , an actuarial consultant at Tillinghast , a unit of Towers Perrin Co. , the big New York consulting firm . \nAnother factor to consider : Some of the companies currently earning very high yields are doing so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been about those lately . \nThere are seemingly endless twists to universal life , and it pays to ask questions about all of them . \nAt a back-yard barbecue , for example , a friend boasts that she 'll only have to pay premiums on her John Hancock policy for seven years and that her death benefits will then be `` guaranteed . '' \nI call her agent , David Dominici . \nYes , he says , premiums on such variable-rate coverage can be structured to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough to generate sufficient cash to cover the annual cost of insurance protection . \nIf interest rates plunge , the insurer may be knocking on my door , asking for steeper premium payments to maintain the same amount of protection . \nI do n't like the sound of that . \nSome insurers have also started offering `` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield , if the policy is maintained for 10 years . \nBut Glenn Daily , a New York-based financial consultant , warns that many of these bonuses are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed by the companies . \nAnd the feature is so new , he adds , that no insurer has yet established a track record for actually making such payments . \nSo-called living-benefits provisions also merit a close inspection . \nOffered by insurers that include Security-Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , these policy riders let me tap a portion of my death benefits while I 'm still alive . \nSome provisions would let me collect a percentage of the policy 's face value to pay for long-term care such as nursing-home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants . \nBut the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance . \nAlso , financial planners advising on insurance say that to their knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes . \nAnd considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that people interested in , say , paying for extended nursing-home care would be better off just buying a separate policy that provides it . \nI 'm more favorably impressed by `` no-load life , '' even though it turns out to be low-load life . \nInsureres selling these policies market them directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but I figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for dropping the policy early still saves me a lot . \nI compared one universal policy for $ 130,000 face amount from such an insurer , American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. , with a similar offering from Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. , which operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen . \nAfter one year I could walk away from the Ameritas policy with $ 792 , but Id get only $ 14 from the Equitable . \nThe difference is magnified by time , too . \nAt age 65 , when I 'd stop paying premiums , the Ameritas offering would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 higher than the other , even though the Equitable 's policy illustration assumed a fractionally higher interest rate . \nDid I buy it ? \nWell , not yet . \nI 'm thinking about using the $ 871 annual premium to finance a trip to Paris first . \nA person can do some heavy thinking about insurance there -- and shop for something more exciting while she 's doing it . \nRorer Group Inc. will report that third-quarter profit rose more than 15 % from a year earlier , though the gain is wholly due to asset sales , Robert Cawthorn , chairman , president and chief executive officer , said . \nHis projection indicates profit in the latest quarter of more than $ 17.4 million , or 55 cents a share , compared with $ 15.2 million , or 48 cents a share , a year ago . \nMr. Cawthorn said in an interview that sales will show an increase from a year ago of `` somewhat less than 10 % . '' \nThrough the first six months of 1989 , sales had grown about 12 % from the year-earlier period . \nGrowth of 10 % would make sales for the latest quarter $ 269 million , compared with $ 244.6 million a year ago . \nMr. Cawthorn said the profit growth in the latest quarter was due to the sale of two Rorer drugs . \nAsilone , an antacid , was sold to Boots PLC , London . \nThrombinar , a drug used to stanch bleeding , was sold to Jones Medical Industries Inc. , St. Louis . \nHe said Rorer sold the drugs for `` nice prices '' and will record a combined , pretax gain on the sales of $ 20 million . \nAs the gain from the sales indicates , operating profit was `` significantly '' below the year-earlier level , Mr. Cawthorn said . \nRorer in July had projected lower third-quarter operating profit but higher profit for all of 1989 . \nHe said the company is still looking for `` a strong fourth quarter in all areas -- sales , operating income and net income . '' \nMr. Cawthorn attributed the decline in third-quarter operating profit to the stronger dollar , which reduces the value of overseas profit when it is translated into dollars ; to accelerated buying of Rorer products in the second quarter because of a then-pending July 1 price increase , and to higher marketing expenses for Rorer 's Maalox antacid , whose sales and market share in the U.S. had slipped in the first half of 1989 . \nHe said Rorer opted to sell Asilone and Thrombinar to raise revenue that would `` kick start '' its increased marketing efforts behind Maalox , still its top-selling product with about $ 215 million in world-wide sales in 1988 . \n`` We had underfunded Maalox for a year , '' he said , because the company was concentrating on research and development and promoting other drugs . \nHe said Rorer will spend $ 15 million to $ 20 million more on Maalox advertising and promotion in the second half of 1989 than in the year-earlier period . \nA `` big chunk '' of that additional spending came in the third quarter , he said . \nHoechst AG said it will stop producing fertilizer in 1990 because of continued losses and a bleak outlook . \nThe West German chemical concern said it will close the last remaining fertilizer plant in Oberhausen in the fall of next year . \nHoechst said the fertilizer market faces overcapacity in Western Europe , rising imports from East bloc countries and overseas , and declining demand . \nHomeFed Corp. said its main subsidiary , Home Federal Savings & Loan , converted from a federal savings and loan to a federal savings bank and changed its name to HomeFed Bank . \nThe federal Office of Thrift Supervision approved the conversion last Friday , HomeFed said . \nThe change in charter does n't alter the federal insurance of deposits , federal regulatory powers or company operations , a spokesman said . \nIt was the second anniversary of the 1987 crash , but this time it was different . \nStocks rallied on good earnings reports and on data that showed less inflation than expected . \nBlue chips led the march up in heavy trading . \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 39.55 points to 2683.20 . \nThe 30 industrials led the market higher from the opening bell as foreign buyers stepped in . \nBy afternoon , the broader market joined the advance in full strength . \nStandard & Poor 's 500-stock Index rose 5.37 to 347.13 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 7.52 to 470.80 . \nNew York Stock Exchange volume swelled to 198,120,000 shares . \nThe industrials were up about 60 points in the afternoon , but cautious investors took profits before the close . \nTraders said a variety of factors triggered the rally . \nThe consumer price index rose 0.2 % in September , while many economists were looking for a 0.4 % increase . \nStock-index arbitrage buy programs -- in which traders buy stock against offsetting positions in futures to lock in price differences -- helped the rally 's momentum . \nThe euphoria was such that investors responded to good earnings reports of companies such as American Express , while ignoring the disappointing profits of companies such as Caterpillar , analysts said . \nStock-index arbitrage trading was a minor influence in yesterday 's rally , traders said . \nInstitutional buyers were the main force pushing blue chips higher . \nTo the amazement of some traders , takeover stocks were climbing again . \nHilton rose 2 7\\/8 to 100 , for example . \nLast Friday , takeover traders spilled out of Hilton , knocking the stock down 21 1\\/2 to 85 . \nAmong other stocks involved in restructurings or rumored to be so : Holiday Corp. gained 1 7\\/8 to 73 and Honeywell rose 2 7\\/8 to 81 1\\/2 . \nOne floor trader noted in astonishment that nobody seemed to mind the news that British Airways is n't making a special effort to revive the UAL buy-out . \nThe announcement of the buy-out 's troubles triggered the market 's nose dive a week ago . \nTakeover enthusiasm may have been renewed when an investor group disclosed yesterday that it had obtained all the financing required to complete its $ 1.6 billion leveraged buy-out of American Medical International . \n`` That 's put some oomph back into this market , '' said Peter VandenBerg , a vice president of equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton . \nBut some traders thought there was less to the rally than met the eye . \n`` There is no strength behind this rally , '' asserted Chung Lew , head trader at Kleinwort Benson North America . \n`` It 's traders squaring positions . \nIt 's not good ; the market is setting up for another fall . '' \nIndeed , many traders said that uncertainty about today 's monthly expiration of stocks-index futures and options , and options on individual stocks , prompted a lot of buying by speculative traders who were unwinding positions that were bets on declining stock prices . \nThe number of outstanding contracts in the October Major Market Index jumped from 5,273 on Friday to 9,023 on Monday . \nThe MMI is a 20-stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average . \nOutstanding contracts are those that remain to be liquidated . \nBy Wednesday , the outstanding October contracts amounted to 8,524 , representing about $ 1.13 billion in stock , noted Donald Selkin , head of stock-index futures research at Prudential-Bache Securities , who expects a volatile expiration today . \n`` There has been a tremendous increase '' in MMI positions , Mr. Selkin said . \nConsumer stocks once again set the pace for blue-chip issues . \nPhilip Morris added 1 1\\/8 to 44 1\\/2 in Big Board composite trading of 3.7 million shares , Coca-Cola Co. gained 2 3\\/8 to 70 3\\/8 , Merck gained 1 3\\/8 to 77 3\\/8 and American Telephone & Telegraph advanced 7\\/8 to 43 3\\/8 on 2.5 million shares . \nAmerican Medical jumped 1 7\\/8 to 23 5\\/8 . \nIMA Acquisition , an investor group that includes First Boston and the Pritzker family of Chicago , said Chemical Bank had made arrangements for 23 other banks to provide $ 509 million in bank financing for the buy-out offer . \nChemical and six other banks , along with First Boston , are providing the rest of the $ 1.6 billion . \nElsewhere on the takeover front , Time Warner advanced 2 5\\/8 to 136 5\\/8 and Warner Communications tacked on 7\\/8 to 63 7\\/8 . \nThe Delaware Supreme Court affirmed a ruling that barred Chris-Craft Industries from voting its Warner preferred stock as a separate class in deciding on the companies ' proposed merger . \nParamount Communications climbed 1 1\\/4 to 58 1\\/2 and MCA rose 1 1\\/2 to 64 ; both media companies have long been mentioned as potential acquisition candidates . \nAmong other actual and rumored targets , Woolworth rose 1 1\\/4 to 60 1\\/2 , Upjohn went up 1 1\\/8 to 39 3\\/4 , Armstrong World Industries gained 1 to 40 1\\/8 and Kollmorgen rose 3\\/4 to 13 7\\/8 . \nIn addition : -- Soo Line jumped 2 3\\/4 to 20 1\\/4 , above the $ 19.50 a share that Canadian Pacific offered for the company in a takeover proposal . \n-- Xtra gained 1 1\\/8 to 27 1\\/8 . \nInvestor Robert M. Gintel , who owns a 4.7 % stake in the company , said he plans a proxy fight for control of its board . \n-- Golden Nugget rose 2 to 28 1\\/4 . \nIts board approved the repurchase of as many as three million common shares , or about 17 % of its shares outstanding . \nBuying interest also resurfaced in the technology sector , including International Business Machines , whose board approved a $ 1 billion increase in its stock buy-back program . \nIBM rose 2 3\\/8 to 104 1\\/8 as 2.2 million shares changed hands . \nCompaq Computer soared 4 5\\/8 to 111 1\\/8 on 1.8 million shares in response to the company 's announcement of plans to introduce several products next month . \nDigital Equipment gained 1 3\\/8 to 89 3\\/4 despite reporting earnings for the September quarter that were on the low end of expectations . \nAmong other technology issues , Cray Research rose 1 5\\/8 to 37 , Hewlett-Packard added 1 1\\/4 to 50 1\\/4 , Tandem Computers rallied 1 1\\/8 to 25 3\\/4 , Data General rose 3\\/4 to 14 1\\/2 and Motorola gained 2 3\\/8 to 59 1\\/4 . \nOn the other hand , Symbol Technologies dropped 1 1\\/4 to 18 1\\/2 after Shearson Lehman Hutton lowered its short-term investment rating on the stock and its 1989 earnings estimate , and Commodore International fell 7\\/8 to 8 after the company said it expects to post a loss for the September quarter . \nInsurance stocks continued to climb on expectations that premium rates will rise in the aftermath of the earthquake in the San Francisco area . \nAmerican International Group climbed 4 to 106 5\\/8 , General Re rose 3 1\\/8 to 89 5\\/8 , Kemper added 2 1\\/2 to 48 , AON went up 1 3\\/8 to 36 and Chubb rose 1 1\\/4 to 82 1\\/4 . \nStocks of major toy makers rallied in the wake of strong third-quarter earnings reports . \nMattel added 1 1\\/4 to 19 5\\/8 , Tonka firmed 1 to 18 1\\/2 and Lewis Galoob Toys rose 7\\/8 to 13 5\\/8 on the Big Board , while Hasbro gained 1 to 21 7\\/8 on the American Stock Exchange . \nCapital Cities-ABC surged 42 5\\/8 to 560 . \nKidder Peabody raised its investment rating on the stock and its earnings estimates for 1989 and 1990 , based on optimism that the company 's ABC television network will continue to fare well in the ratings . \nDun & Bradstreet lost 1 7\\/8 to 51 7\\/8 on 1.8 million shares . \nMerrill Lynch lowered its short-term rating on the stock and its estimate of 1990 earnings , citing a sales slowdown in the company 's credit-rating business . \nPinnacle West Capital , which suspended its common-stock dividend indefinitely and reported a 91 % decline in third-quarter earnings , fell 5\\/8 to 11 3\\/8 . \nThe Amex Market Value Index recorded its sharpest gain of the year by climbing 4.74 to 382.81 . \nVolume totaled 14,580,000 shares . \nB.A.T Industries , the most active Amex issue , rose 3\\/8 to 12 3\\/8 . \nThe company received shareholder approval for its restructuring plan , designed to fend off a hostile takeover bid from a group headed by financier Sir James Goldsmith . \nChambers Development Class A jumped 3 1\\/8 to 37 1\\/8 and Class B rose 2 5\\/8 to 37 1\\/4 . \nThe company said six officers are buying a total of $ 1.5 million of its stock . \nTRC Cos. , the target of an investigation by the U.S. inspector general , dropped 2 to 10 3\\/4 . \nThe probe involves testing procedures used on certain government contracts by the company 's Metatrace unit . \nAvondale Industries Inc. , New Orleans , received a $ 23 million contract from the Navy to enlarge by 50 % the capacity of an auxiliary oiler . \nThe award results from the Navy 's exercising of an option in an earlier contract it awarded Avondale . \nRichard J. Pinola was elected to the board of this personnel consulting concern , increasing its size to nine members . \nMr. Pinola is president and chief operating officer of Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co . \nThe Senate rejected a constitutional amendment that President Bush sought to protect the U.S. flag from desecration . \nThe 51-48 roll call fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to approve changes to the Constitution . \nThe vote , in which 11 GOP lawmakers voted against Mr. Bush 's position , was a victory for Democratic leaders , who opposed the amendment as an intrusion on the Bill of Rights . \n`` We can support the American flag without changing the American Constitution , '' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine . \nIn order to defuse pressure for an amendment , Mr. Mitchell and House Speaker Thomas Foley -LRB- D. , Wash . -RRB- had arranged for lawmakers to pass a statute barring flag desecration before voting on the constitutional change . \nMr. Bush said he would allow the bill to become law without his signature , because he said only a constitutional amendment can protect the flag adequately . \nIn June , the Supreme Court threw out the conviction of a Texas man who set a flag afire during a 1984 demonstration , saying he was `` engaging in political expression '' that is protected by the First Amendment . \nIf you think you have stress-related problems on the job , there 's good news and bad news . \nYou 're probably right , and you are n't alone . \nA new Gallup Poll study commissioned by the New York Business Group on Health , found that a full 25 % of the work force at companies may suffer from anxiety disorders or a stress-related illness , with about 13 % suffering from depression . \nThe study surveyed a national group of medical directors , personnel managers and employee assistance program directors about their perceptions of these problems in their companies . \nIt is one of a series of studies on health commissioned by the New York Business Group , a non-profit organization with about 300 members . \nThe stress study was undertaken because problems related to stress `` are much more prevalent than they seem , '' said Leon J. Warshaw , executive director of the business group . \nIn presenting the study late last week , Dr. Warshaw estimated the cost of these types of disorders to business is substantial . \nOccupational disability related to anxiety , depression and stress costs about $ 8,000 a case in terms of worker 's compensation . \nIn terms of days lost on the job , the study estimated that each affected employee loses about 16 work days a year because of stress , anxiety or depression . \nHe added that the cost for stress-related compensation claims is about twice the average for all injury claims . \n`` We hope to sensitize employers '' to recognize the problems so they can do something about them , Dr. Warshaw said . \nEarly intervention into these types of problems can apparently save businesses long-term expense associated with hospitalization , which sometimes results when these problems go untreated for too long . \nEven the courts are beginning to recognize the link between jobs and stress-related disorders in compensation cases , according to a survey by the National Council on Compensation Insurance . \nBut although 56 % of the respondents in the study indicated that mental-health problems were fairly pervasive in the workplace , there is still a social stigma associated with people seeking help . \nThe disorders , which 20 years ago struck middle-age and older people , `` now strike people at the height of productivity , '' says Robert M.A. Hirschfeld , of the National Institute of Mental Health , who spoke at the presentation of the study 's findings . \nThe poll showed that company size had a bearing on a manager 's view of the problem , with 65 % of those in companies of more than 15,000 employees saying stress-related problems were `` fairly pervasive '' and 55 % of those in companies with fewer than 4,000 employees agreeing . \nThe poll also noted fear of a takeover as a stress-producing event in larger companies . \nMore than eight in 10 respondents reported such a stress-provoking situation in their company . \nMid-sized companies were most affected by talk of layoffs or plant closings . \nThe study , which received funding from Upjohn Co. , which makes several drugs to treat stress-related illnesses , also found 47 % of the managers said stress , anxiety and depression contribute to decreased production . \nAlcohol and substance abuse as a result of stress-related problems was cited by 30 % of those polled . \nAlthough Dr. Warshaw points out that stress and anxiety have their positive uses , `` stress perceived to be threatening implies a component of fear and anxiety that may contribute to burnout . '' \nHe also noted that various work environments , such as night work , have their own `` stressors . '' \n`` We all like stress , but there 's a limit , '' says Paul D'Arcy , of Rohrer , Hibler & Replogle , a corporate psychology and management consulting firm . \nThe problem , says Mr. D'Arcy , a psychologist , is that `` it 's very hard to get any hard measures on how stress affects job performance . \nFor Cheap Air Fares , Spend Christmas Aloft \nIT IS N'T TRUE that a 90-year old clergyman on a mission of mercy to a disaster area on Christmas Day can fly free . \nBut his circumstances are among the few that can qualify for the handful of really cheap airline tickets remaining in America . \nIn recent years , carriers have become much more picky about who can fly on the cheap . \nBut there still are a few ways today 's traveler can qualify under the airline 's many restrictions . \nOne of the best deals , though , may mean skipping Christmas dinner with the relatives . \nThis week , many carriers are announcing cut-rate fares designed to get people to fly on some of the most hallowed -- and slowest -- days of the year , including Christmas . \nIn recent years , the airlines had waited until the last moment to court Christmas season vacationers with bargain fares . \nThat approach flopped : Last Christmas Day , a USAir Group Inc. DC-9 jetliner flew about seven passengers from Chicago to Pittsburgh . \nSo this year , the airlines are getting a jump on holiday discounts . \nThey are cutting ticket prices by as much as 70 % from normal levels for travel to most U.S. locations on Dec. 24 , 25 , 29 , 30 and 31 , and Jan. 4 , 5 and 6 . \nThe promotions -- dubbed everything from 'T- is the Season to be Jolly to Kringle fares -- put round-trip fares at $ 98 , $ 148 and $ 198 . \n`` They 're trying to keep planes flying on days they 'd normally park them , '' says Roger Bard , president of Mr. Mitchell Travel Service in Burnsville , N.C . \nExpect , of course , sky-high prices on other dates near the holidays when the airlines know vacationers are eager to travel . \nConsider Adopting Your Spouse 's Name \nIF CONTINENTAL Airlines has its way , couples like Marlo Thomas and Phil Donahue may find it a hassle to qualify for some new discounts . \nContinental , a Texas Air Corp. unit , recently unveiled a marketing program offering free companion tickets to business-class and first-class passengers on international flights . \nThe Continental catch : Only immediate family members are allowed , and they must have the same last name as the buyer of the ticket or legal proof they 're related . \nThat irritates many women who have n't taken their husbands ' last name . \n`` What a bunch of nonsense , '' says Jessica Crosby , president of the New York chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners . \n`` This sets things way back . '' \nContinental 's logic : It does n't want business companions abusing the promotion by falsely claiming to be related . \n`` We accommodate their choice of names by allowing them to demonstrate '' family affiliation with legal documents , says Jim O'Donnell , a senior vice president . \nBut gay rights advocates are angry , too . \nThe Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund of New York City has received complaints from homosexual couples whom the airline does n't recognize as family . \n`` It 's certainly discrimination , '' says attorney Evan Wolfson , whose group forced Trans World Airlines this year to change a rule that allowed travelers to transfer frequent flier awards only to family members . \nTake Your Vacation In a Hurricane Area \nWHEN HURRICANE Hugo careened through the Caribbean and the Atlantic coast states , it downed electric and telephone lines , shot coconuts through cottage rooftops , shattered windows and uprooted thousands of lives . \nIt also lowered some air fares . \nSince the hurricane , Midway Airlines Inc. and American Airlines , a unit of AMR Corp. , trimmed their one-way fares to the Virgin Islands to $ 109 from prices that were at times double that before the storm . \nThe fares are code-named Hugo , Compassion and Virgin Islands Aid . \n-LRB- Airlines are n't lowering fares to Northern California following this week 's earthquake , but reservation agents can waive advance-purchase restrictions on discount fares for emergency trips . -RRB- \nSome hotels in the hurricane-stricken Caribbean promise money-back guarantees . \nIn Myrtle Beach , S.C. , the damaged Yachtsman Resort offers daily rates as low as $ 35 , or as much as 22 % below regular prices . \nSays Michele Hoffman , a clerk in the resort 's front office : `` We do n't have the outdoor pool , the pool table , ping pong table , snack bar or VCR , but we still have the indoor pool and Jacuzzi . '' \nJust Wait Until You 're a Bit Older \nSENIOR CITIZENS have long received cheap air fares . \nThis year , the older someone is the bigger the discount . \nA senior citizen between 62 and 70 saves 70 % off regular coach fare . \nTravelers up to age 99 get a percentage discount matching their age . \nAnd centenarians fly free in first class . \nNext month , Northwest Airlines says , a 108-year-old Lansing , Mich. , woman is taking it up on the offer to fly with her 72-year-old son to Tampa , Fla . \nLast year when Northwest first offered the promotion , only six centenarians flew free . \nIf All Else Fails ... . \nTHE NATION'S carriers also provide discounts to Red Cross workers , retired military personnel and medical students . \nThere 's even a special fare for clergy that does n't require the usual stay over Saturday night . \nThat way , they can be home in time for work Sunday . \nThe British Petroleum Co. PLC said its BP Exploration unit has produced the first oil from its Don oilfield in the North Sea . \nIn an official release , BP said initial production from the field was 11,000 barrels a day , and that it expects peak output from the field of 15,000 barrels a day to be reached in 1990 . \nAs the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which would repeal the Social Security earnings limit for people aged 65 and older , I applaud your strong endorsement to repeal this Depression-era fossil . \nFor every dollar earned over $ 8,880 , Social Security recipients lose 50 cents of their Social Security benefits ; it 's like a 50 % marginal tax . \nBut the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates . \nImagine a widow who wants to maintain her standard of living at the same level she had before she had to pay the catastrophic surtax . \nAlthough this widow earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to the earnings limit , she would have to earn an additional $ 4,930 to offset her catastrophic surtax of $ 496 . \nEliminating the earnings limit would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit . \nRepeal would generate more in new taxes than the government would lose in increased Social Security benefit payments . \nWe now need support from the Democrats on the Rules Committee in order to include earnings-limit reform in the Reconciliation Bill . \nSince all four Republicans on the committee are co-sponsors of my bill , it is the Democrats who will be held fully accountable if an earnings test amendment is not allowed from the floor . \nThe time is now to lift the burdensome Social Security earnings limit from the backs of our nation 's seniors . \nRep. J. Dennis Hastert -LRB- R. , Ill . -RRB- \nWhen his Seventh Avenue fur business here was flying high 20 years ago , Jack Purnick had 25 workers and a large factory . \nNow his half-dozen employees work in an eighth-floor shop that he says is smaller than his old storage room . \nHe also says he is losing money now . \nHe blames imports . \nBut just down Seventh Avenue , where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made , Larry Rosen has acquired two retail outlets , broadened his fur-making line and expanded into leather . \nHe credits imports . \nThe difference lies in how the two entrepreneurial furriers reacted to the foreign competition and transformation of their industry over the past 10 years . \nOne stuck to old-line business traditions , while the other embraced the change . \n`` The small , good fur salon is not what it used to be , '' says Mr. Purnick , 75 years old . \n`` We make the finest product in the world , and the Americans are being kicked around . '' \nMr. Rosen , though , believes imports have reinvigorated the industry in which he has worked for most of his 57 years . \n`` You 've got some minds here that wo n't think progressively , '' he says . \nImport competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started aggressively marketing `` working-girl mink '' and similar lower-priced imported furs in recent years . \nMerchants discovered a consumer largely ignored by higher-priced furriers : the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who never thought she could buy a mink . \nThe new market helped boost U.S. fur sales to about $ 1.8 billion a year now , triple the level in the late 1970s . \nIt also opened the door to furs made in South Korea , China , Hong Kong and other countries . \nJindo Furs , a large South Korean maker , says it operates 35 retail outlets in the U.S. and plans to open 15 more by the end of next year . \nMr. Purnick and other old-line furriers call many of the the imports unstylish and poorly made . \nHigh-end U.S. furriers say these imports have n't squeezed them . \nBut low-priced and middle-priced furriers like Mr. Purnick , who once saturated the five-block Seventh Avenue fur district , say imports have cut their sales . \nA woman who once would have saved for two or three seasons to buy a U.S.-made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ 2,000 . \nYet Mr. Rosen has turned the import phenomenon to his advantage . \nEarly in the decade he saw that fur workers in many foreign countries were willing to work longer hours at lower wages than their American counterparts and were more open to innovation . \nIn 1982 , he started a factory in Greece . \nTwo years later , he opened one in West Germany . \nHe also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and he decided to follow suit . \nBy combining his strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , he says he has been able to produce high-quality goods at low cost . \nTo maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources , he says he still makes most of his furs in the U.S. . \nBut six years ago he also began importing from the Far East . \nInspired by imports , Mr. Rosen now makes fur muffs , hats and flings . \nThis year he produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green . \nHe has leather jackets from Turkey that are lined with eel skin and topped off with raccoon-skin collars . \nFrom Asia , he has mink jackets with floral patterns made by using different colored furs . \nNext he will be testing pictured embroidery -LRB- called kalega -RRB- made in the Far East . \nHe plans to attach the embroidery to the backs of mink coats and jackets . \nBesides adding to sales , leathers also attract retailers who may buy furs later , he adds . \nOther furriers have also benefited from leathers . \nSeymour Schreibman , the 65-year-old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc. , treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin to produce a reversible fur-and-leather garment . \nHe says it accounts for 25 % of total sales . \nMr. Rosen is also pushing retail sales . \nThis year he bought two stores , one in Brooklyn and one in Queens . \nOther furriers have also placed more weight on retailing . \nGolden Feldman Furs Inc. began retailing aggressively eight years ago , and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income . \nIn other moves , Mr. Rosen says he bought a truck three years ago to reach more retailers . \nSince then he has expanded his fleet and can now bring his furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest . \nSmall retailers who ca n't afford to travel to his New York showroom have become fair game . \nSuch moves have helped Mr. Rosen weather the industry slump of recent years . \nThe industry enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since 1986 sales have languished at their $ 1.8 billion peak . \nLarge furriers such as Antonovich Inc. , Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc. all reported losses in their latest fiscal years . \nAftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons . \nIn addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , driving prices down . \nThe animal-rights movement has n't helped sales . \nWarm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand , too , furriers complain . \nAnd those who did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages . \n`` The intensive labor needed to manufacture furs -LCB- in the U.S. . -RCB- is not as available as it was , '' says Mr. Schreibman , who is starting overseas production . \nBut even those who have found a way to cope with the imports and the slump , fear that furs are losing part of their allure . \n`` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of the fur business , '' says Stephen Sanders , divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago . \n`` You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists Mr. Purnick , the New York furrier . \nHe contends that chasing consumers with low-priced imports will harm the industry in the long run by reducing the prestige of furs . \nBut Mr. Rosen responds : `` Whatever people want to buy , I 'll sell . \nThe name of the game is to move goods . \nFour workers at GTE Corp. 's headquarters have been diagnosed as having hepatitis , and city health officials are investigating whether a cafeteria worker may have exposed hundreds of other GTE employees to the viral infection , company and city officials said . \nThe four cases were all reported to GTE 's medical director and state and local health authorities . \nGTE shut down its cafeteria Tuesday afternoon after testing determined that at least one cafeteria worker employed by GTE 's private food vending contractor , ARA Services Inc. , was suffering from a strain of the virus , officials said . \nMore than 700 people work in the GTE building . \nThe cafeteria remains closed . \nDr. Andrew McBride , city health director , said his staff suspects the hepatitis , which can be highly contagious , was spread by the cafeteria worker with the virus . \nThe exact strain of hepatitis that the cafeteria worker contracted has n't been determined but should be known by the end of the week , Dr. McBride said . \nHepatitis A , considered the least dangerous strain of the virus , has been confirmed in at least one GTE employee , company and city officials said . \n`` From a public health point of view we 're relieved because hepatitis A is rarely life-threatening , '' said Dr. Frank Provato , GTE 's medical director . \n`` It 's a double-edged sword though , because it is also the most contagious kind of hepatitis . '' \nGTE officials began posting warning notices about the potential threat to exposure Wednesday morning at various places at the company , said GTE spokesman Thomas Mattausch . \nThe company has begun offering shots of gamma globulin , which will diminish the flu-like symptoms of hepatitis A , in anyone who has contracted the disease , Mr. Mattausch said . \n`` We 're strongly recommending that anyone who has eaten in the cafeteria this month have the shot , '' Mr. Mattausch added , `` and that means virtually everyone who works here . \nI was appalled to read the misstatements of facts in your Oct. 13 editorial `` Colombia 's Brave Publisher . '' \nIt is the right-wing guerrillas who are aligned with the drug traffickers , not the left wing . \nThis information was gleaned from your own news stories on the region . \nPast Colombian government tolerance of the `` narcotraficantes '' was due to the drug lords ' history of wiping out leftists in the hinterlands . \nMary Poulin Palo Alto , Calif. \nI suggest that The Wall Street Journal -LRB- as well as other U.S. news publications of like mind -RRB- should put its money where its mouth is : Lend computer equipment to replace that damaged at El Espectador , buy ad space , publish stories under the bylines of El Espectador journalists . \nPerhaps an arrangement could be worked out to `` sponsor '' El Espectador journalists and staff by paying for added security in exchange for exclusive stories . \nReward El Espectador 's courage with real support . \nDouglas B. Evans \nCOCA-COLA Co . -LRB- Atlanta -RRB- -- \nAnton Amon and George Gourlay were elected vice presidents of this soft-drink company . \nMr. Amon , 46 years old , is the company 's director of quality assurance ; most recently , he served as vice president , operations , for Coca-Cola Enterprises . \nMr. Gourlay , 48 , is manager for corporate manufacturing operations ; he was assistant vice president at the company . \nIn the wake of a slide in sterling , a tailspin in the stock market , and a string of problematic economic indicators , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson promised gradual improvement in the U.K. economy . \nIn a speech prepared for delivery to London 's financial community , Mr. Lawson summed up current economic policy as a battle to wring inflation out of the British economy , using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' to carry out the campaign . \nTwo weeks after boosting base rates to 15 % , he pledged that `` rates will have to remain high for some time to come . '' \nMr. Lawson also made it clear that he would be watching exchange rates carefully . \nA sinking pound makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , he argued . \nIn an apparent warning to currency traders who have lately been selling the British currency , he stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . '' \nIn reaffirming the current monetary policy of using high interest rates to fight inflation and shore up the pound , Mr. Lawson dismissed other approaches to managing the economy . \nHe said he monitors the money-supply figures , but does n't give them paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested . \nMr. Lawson also dismissed the possibility of imposing direct credit controls on Britain 's financial system . \nMr. Lawson 's speech , delivered at the Lord Mayor of London 's annual dinner at Mansion House , came on the heels of a grueling period for the U.K. economy . \nTwo weeks ago , in a campaign to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world-wide plunge in the pound , he raised base rates a full percentage point to 15 % . \nDespite the increase , the British currency slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week . \nIt was quoted at 2.9428 marks in late New York trading Wednesday . \nLeading up to the speech was a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that the British war on inflation will be more bruising than previously assumed . \nUnemployment in September dropped to 1,695,000 , the lowest level since 1980 . \nWhile lower joblessness is generally good news , the hefty drop last month indicates that the economy is n't slowing down as much as hoped -- despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months . \nMeanwhile , average earnings in Britain were up 8.75 % in August over the previous year . \nAnother inflationary sign came in a surge in building-society lending to a record # 10.2 billion -LRB- $ 16.22 billion -RRB- last month , a much higher level than economists had predicted . \nIn a separate speech prepared for delivery at the dinner , Robin Leigh-Pemberton , Bank of England governor , conceded that `` demand pressures were even more buoyant than had been appreciated '' when the British economy was heating up last year . \nHe added that `` there 's no quick-fix solution '' to the economic woes , and said `` tight monetary policy is the right approach . '' \nDiscussing the recent slide in stock prices , the central bank governor stated that `` the markets now appear to have steadied '' after the `` nasty jolt '' of the 190.58-point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago . \nAlthough the New York market plunge prompted a 70.5-point drop in the London Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index , Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declared `` that the experience owed nothing to the particular problems of the British economy . '' \nSpecifically , he pointed out that compared with the U.S. market , the U.K. has far fewer highly leveraged junk-bond financings . \nDiscussing future monetary arrangements , Mr. Lawson repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but he did n't indicate when . \nIng . \nC. Olivetti & Co. , claiming it has won the race in Europe to introduce computers based on a powerful new microprocessor chip , unveiled its CP486 computer yesterday . \nThe product is the first from a European company based on Intel Corp. 's new 32-bit 486tm microprocessor , which works several times faster than previously available chips . \nHewlett-Packard Co. became the first company world-wide to announce a product based on the chip earlier this month , but it wo n't start shipping the computers until early next year . \nAn Olivetti spokesman said the company 's factories are already beginning to produce the machine , and that it should be available in Europe by December . \n`` What this means is that Europeans will have these machines in their offices before Americans do , '' the spokesman said . \nThe new chip `` is a very big step in computing , and it is important that Olivetti be one of the first out on the market with this product , '' said Patricia Meagher Davis , an analyst at James Capel & Co. in London . \nExecutives at Olivetti , whose earnings have been steadily sliding over the past couple of years , have acknowledged that in the past they have lagged at getting new technology to market . \nMs. Davis said the new machines could steal some sales away from Olivetti 's own minicomputers , but would bring new sales among professionals such as engineers , stockbrokers and medical doctors . \nAlthough Olivetti 's profits tumbled 40 % in the first half of this year , she believes Olivetti 's restructuring last fall and its introduction of new products will begin to bear fruit with an earnings rebound next year , especially if it can fulfill its promise to deliver the new machines by December . \n`` We think the worst is over '' in the European information-technology market , she said . \nDepending on the type of software and peripherals used , the machines can serve either as the main computer in a network of many terminals -LRB- a role usually filled by a minicomputer -RRB- , as a technical workstation or as a very fast personal computer . \n`` It 's the missing link '' in Olivetti 's product line between small personal computers and higher-priced minicomputers , the Olivetti spokesman said . \nHe added that Olivetti will continue making its LSX minicomputer line . \nThe machines will cost around $ 16,250 on average in Europe . \nThe Intel 486 chip can process 15 million instructions per second , or MIPS , while Intel 's previous 386 chip could handle only 3 to 6 MIPS . \nOlivetti also plans to sell the CP486 computer in the U.S. starting next year through Olivetti USA and through its ISC\\/Bunker Ramo unit , which specializes in automating bank-branch networks . \nViatech Inc. said it received approval from the French government for its proposed $ 44.7 million acquisition of Ferembal S.A . \nThe approval satisfies the remaining conditions of the purchase , which is expected to close within two weeks . \nerembal , the second-largest maker of food cans in France , had 1988 sales of $ 150 million . \nFerembal has 930 workers at four canning manufacturing plants and one plastic container facility . \nViatech makes flexible packaging films and machinery , and materials for the food and pharmaceutical industries . \nSocial Security benefits will rise 4.7 % next year to keep pace with inflation , boosting the average monthly benefit to $ 566 from $ 541 , the Department of Health and Human Services announced . \nThe higher payments will start with Social Security checks received on Jan. 3 , 1990 . \nSupplemental Security Income payments to the disabled also will rise 4.7 % , starting with checks received on Dec. 29 , 1988 , increasing the maximum SSI payment to $ 386 from $ 368 a month . \nThe inflation adjustment also means that the maximum annual level of earnings subject to the wage tax that generates revenue for the Social Security trust fund will rise to $ 50,400 in 1990 from $ 48,000 this year . \nAs mandated by law , the tax rate will rise to 7.65 % in 1990 from 7.51 % and wo n't rise any further in the future . \nThis means that the maximum yearly Social Security tax paid by workers and employers each will rise $ 250.80 next year to $ 3,855.60 . \nBeneficiaries aged 65 through 69 will be able to earn $ 9,360 without losing any Social Security benefits in 1990 , up from $ 8,880 this year . \nThe exempt amount for beneficiaries under 65 will rise to $ 6,840 from $ 6,480 . \nThe adjustments reflect the increase in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers from the third quarter of last year to the third quarter of this year . \nHealth-care companies should get healthier in the third quarter . \nMedical-supply houses are expected to report earnings increases of about 15 % on average for the third quarter , despite sales increases of less than 10 % , analysts say . \nTo offset sluggish sales growth , companies have been cutting staff , mostly through attrition , and slowing the growth in research and development spending . \nSales growth in the quarter was slowed by mounting pressure from groups of buyers , such as hospitals , to hold down prices . \nSuppliers were also hurt by the stronger U.S. dollar , which makes sales abroad more difficult . \nIn some cases , competition has squeezed margins . \nBecton , Dickinson & Co. , for example , faces stiff competition from a Japanese supplier in the important syringe market . \nThe Franklin Lakes , N.J. , company is expected to report sales growth of only 5 % to 6 % , but should still maintain earnings growth of 10 % , says Jerry E. Fuller , an analyst with Duff & Phelps Inc . \nAmong the first of the group to post results , Abbott Laboratories said third-quarter net income jumped 14 % to $ 196 million , or 88 cents a share , from $ 172 million , or 76 cents a share , a year earlier . \nSales for the company , based in Abbott Park , Ill. , rose 8.3 % to $ 1.31 billion from $ 1.21 billion . \nBaxter International Inc. yesterday reported net climbed 20 % in the third period to $ 102 million , or 34 cents a share , from $ 85 million , or 28 cents a share , a year earlier . \nSales for the Deerfield , Ill. , company rose 5.8 % to $ 1.81 billion from $ 1.71 billion . \nBut not every company expects to report increased earnings . \nC.R. Bard Inc. yesterday said third-quarter net plunged 51 % to $ 9.9 million , or 18 cents a share , from $ 20 million , or 35 cents a share , a year earlier . \nSales fell 1.2 % to $ 190.1 million from $ 192.5 million . \nThe Murray Hill , N.J. , company said full-year earnings may be off 33 cents a share because the company removed a catheter from the market . \nIn 1988 , the company earned $ 1.38 a share . \nThe Food and Drug Administration had raised questions about the device 's design . \nSome analysts add that third-party pressures to reduce health costs will continue to bedevil companies ' bottom lines . \nTakeover speculation , which has been buoying stocks of supply houses , may also ease , says Peter Sidoti , an analyst with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . \n`` As that wanes , you 're going to see the stocks probably wane as well , '' he says . \nHospitals companies , meanwhile , are reporting improved earnings . \nBolstered by strong performances by its psychiatric hospitals , National Medical Enterprises Inc. , Los Angeles , reported net income of $ 50 million , or 65 cents a share , for the first quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 41 million , or 56 cents a share , a year earlier . \nHumana Inc. , Louisville , Ky. , also reported favorable results , with net income of $ 66.7 million , or 66 cents , in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31 , up from $ 58.2 million , or 59 cents , a year earlier . \nAnalysts say the handful of hospital companies that are still publicly traded are benefiting from several trends . \nMost important , hospital admission rates are stabilizing after several years of decline . \nMoreover , companies have sold off many of their smaller , less-profitable hospitals and have completed painful restructurings . \nHumana 's revenues , for example , are being boosted by large increases in enrollments in the company 's health maintenance organizations . \nSays Todd Richter , an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds : `` The shakeout in the publicly traded companies is over . \nInitial claims for regular state unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 396,000 during the week ended Oct. 7 from 334,000 the previous week , the Labor Department said . \nThe number of people receiving regular state benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 decreased to a seasonally adjusted 2,202,000 , or 2.2 % of those covered by unemployment insurance , from 2,205,000 the previous week , when the insured unemployment rate also was 2.2 % . \nCounting all state and federal benefit programs , the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Sept. 30 fell to 1,809,300 from 1,838,200 a week earlier . \nThese figures are n't seasonally adjusted . \nA Labor Department spokesman said the unusually high number of initial claims for state unemployment benefits reflects the impact of Hurricane Hugo on southern states , particularly North Carolina and South Carolina . \nThe figure also may reflect initial claims filed by striking Nynex Corp. workers who have become eligible for unemployment benefits , the official said . \nDigital Equipment Corp. reported a 32 % decline in net income on a modest revenue gain in its fiscal first quarter , causing some analysts to predict weaker results ahead than they had expected . \nAlthough the second-largest computer maker had prepared Wall Street for a poor quarter , analysts said they were troubled by signs of flat U.S. orders and a slowdown in the rate of gain in foreign orders . \nThe Maynard , Mass. , company is in a transition in which it is trying to reduce its reliance on mid-range machines and establish a presence in workstations and mainframes . \nNet for the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell to $ 150.8 million , or $ 1.20 a share , from $ 223 million , or $ 1.71 a share , a year ago . \nRevenue rose 6.4 % to $ 3.13 billion from $ 2.94 billion . \nDigital said a shift in its product mix toward low-end products and strong growth in workstation sales yielded lower gross margins . \nA spokesman also said margins for the company 's service business narrowed somewhat because of heavy investments made in that sector . \nThe lack of a strong product at the high end of Digital 's line was a significant drag on sales . \nDigital hopes to address that with the debut of its first mainframe-class computers next Tuesday . \nThe new line is aimed directly at International Business Machines Corp . \n`` Until the new mainframe products kick in , there wo n't be a lot of revenue contribution at the high end , and that 's hurt us , '' said Mark Steinkrauss , Digital 's director of investor relations . \nHe said unfavorable currency translations were also a factor in the quarter . \nDEC shares rose $ 1.375 to $ 89.75 apiece in consolidated New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday . \nBut analysts said that against the backdrop of a nearly 40-point rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average , that should n't necessarily be taken as a sign of great strength . \nSome cut their earnings estimates for the stock this year and predicted more efforts to control costs ahead . \n`` I think the next few quarters will be difficult , '' said Steven Milunovich of First Boston . \n`` Margins will remain under pressure , and when the new mainframe does ship , I 'm not sure it will be a big winner . \n'' Mr. Milunovich said he was revising his estimate for DEC 's current year from $ 8.20 a share to `` well below $ 8 , '' although he has n't settled on a final number . \nOne troubling aspect of DEC 's results , analysts said , was its performance in Europe . \nDEC said its overseas business , which now accounts for more than half of sales , improved in the quarter . \nIt even took the unusually frank step of telling analysts in a morning conference call that orders in Europe were up in `` double digits '' in foreign-currency terms . \nThat gain probably translated into about 5 % to 7 % in dollar terms , well below recent quarters ' gains of above 20 % , reckons Jay Stevens of Dean Witter Reynolds . \n`` That was a disappointment '' and a sign of overall computer-market softness in Europe , Mr. Stevens said . \nMarc Schulman , with UBS Securities in New York , dropped his estimate of DEC 's full-year net to $ 6.80 a share from $ 8 . \nAlthough overall revenues were stronger , Mr. Schulman said , DEC `` drew down its European backlog '' and had flat world-wide orders overall . \n`` The bottom line is that it 's more hand to mouth than it has been before , '' he said . \nMr. Schulman said he believes that the roll-out of DEC 's new mainframe will `` occur somewhat more leisurely '' than many of his investment colleagues expect . \nHe said current expectations are for an entry level machine to be shipped in December , with all of the more sophisticated versions out by June . \nFor reasons he would n't elaborate on , he said he 's sure that schedule wo n't be met , meaning less profit impact from the product for DEC in the next few quarters . \nJohn R. Wilke contributed to this article . \nColgate Palmolive Co. reported third-quarter net income rose 27 % , bolstered by strong sales in its Latin American business and surprisingly healthy profits from U.S. operations . \nColgate said net income for the quarter rose to $ 76.7 million , or $ 1.06 a share , on sales that increased 6 % to $ 1.3 billion . \nIn the year-earlier period , Colgate posted net income of $ 60.2 million , or 88 cents a share . \nLast year 's results included earnings from discontinued operations of $ 13.1 million , or 19 cents a share . \nReuben Mark , chairman and chief executive officer of Colgate , said earnings growth was fueled by strong sales in Latin America , the Far East and Europe . \nResults were also bolstered by `` a very meaningful increase in operating profit at Colgate 's U.S. business , '' he said . \nOperating profit at Colgate 's U.S. household products and personal care businesses , which include such well-known brands as Colgate toothpaste and Fab laundry detergent , jumped more than 40 % , the company said . \nMr. Mark attributed the improvement to cost savings achieved by consolidating manufacturing operations , blending together two sales organizations and more carefully focusing the company 's promotional activities . \n`` We 've done a lot to improve -LRB- U.S. . -RRB- results and a lot more will be done , '' Mr. Mark said . \n`` Improving profitability of U.S. operations is an extremely high priority in the company . '' \nColgate 's results were at the high end of the range of analysts ' forecasts . \nThe scope of the improvement in the U.S. business caught some analysts by surprise . \nThe company 's domestic business , especially its household products division , has performed poorly for years . \nAnalysts say the earnings improvement came from cutting costs rather than increasing sales . \nFor the nine months , net increased 14 % to $ 217.5 million , or $ 3.09 a share . \nSales rose 7 % to $ 3.8 billion . \nThe company earned $ 191.1 million , or $ 2.79 a share , in the year-earlier period . \nColgate 's 1988 net income included $ 40.1 million , or 59 cents a share , from discontinued operations . \nColgate sold its hospital supply and home health care business last year . \nSeparately , Colgate Wednesday finalized an agreement with MacroChem Corp. , a tiny dental products and pharmaceutical concern based in Billerica , Mass. , to market in the U.S. four of MacroChem 's FDA-approved dental products . \nThe products -- sealants and bonding materials used by dentists -- all contain fluoride that is released over time . \nThe move is part of a drive to increase Colgate 's business with dentists , a company spokeswoman said . \nTerms of the agreement were n't given . \nUSACafes Limited Partnership said it completed the sale of its Bonanza restaurant franchise system to a subsidiary of Metromedia Co. for $ 71 million in cash . \nUSACafes , which is nearly half-owned by Sam and Charles Wyly of Dallas , said it will distribute proceeds from the sale to unit holders as a liquidating dividend as soon as possible . \nThe Bonanza franchise system , which generates about $ 600 million in sales annually , represented substantially all of the partnership 's assets . \nThe sale of the system has been challenged in a class-action suit on behalf of unit holders filed last week in a Delaware court , USACafes said . \nThe company said it believes the suit is without merit . \nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph Co. unveiled a sweetened pension and early-retirement program for management that it hopes will enable it to save $ 450 million in the next year . \nAT&T also said net income rose 19 % in the third quarter . \nAT&T said its amended pension program will nearly double to 34,000 the number of managers eligible to retire with immediate pension payments . \nAT&T said that based on studies of other companies that have offered retirement plans , it expects about one-third of its eligible managers to retire under the new program . \nAT&T said third-quarter net income grew , despite stiff competition in all of the company 's markets . \nNet income rose to $ 699 million , or 65 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 587 million , or 55 cents a share . \nRevenue edged up to $ 8.9 billion from $ 8.81 billion . \nThe latest period 's net was reduced $ 102 million , or nine cents a share , for a change in depreciation method and concurrent changes in estimates of depreciable lives and net salvage for certain telecommunications equipment . \nThe results roughly matched estimates of securities analysts , who were encouraged by AT&T increasing its operating margin to 13 % from 11 % a year ago , because of continued cost-cutting efforts . \nSales of long-distance services , an extremely competitive market , rose 6.4 % . \nBut the growth was partly offset by lower equipment sales and rentals and price cuts on some products . \nUnder the amended pension program , AT&T managers who have at least five years of service will have five years added to their age and length of service for pension purposes . \nManagers who retire Dec. 30 will have an additional 15 % added to their monthly pension for as long as five years or age 65 , whichever comes earlier . \nAn AT&T spokeswoman said the company would likely replace about one-third of its managers who choose to retire with new employees . \nAnalysts hailed the sweetened pension package , which they said had been the subject of rumors for several months . \n`` This tells you AT&T is serious about continuing to manage their cost structure and is committed to 20%-a-year earnings growth , '' said Jack Grubman , an analyst with PaineWebber Inc . \nBut other analysts expressed disappointment that the cost-cutting move wo n't result in even greater earnings growth . \n`` This is a good move , but it only gets you to where people 's expectations already are , '' in terms of earnings growth , said Joel D. Gross , an analyst with Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette . \nMr. Gross said he had hoped that a cost savings of $ 450 million would result in even greater growth than the 20 % annual earnings increase AT&T has told analysts it expects in the future . \nAT&T said the special retirement option will increase fourth-quarter expenses . \nBut the company said the amount ca n't be determined until it knows how many managers opt to retire . \nAT&T said the expense increase will be largely offset by a gain from its previously announced plan to swap its holdings in Ing . C. Olivetti & Co. for shares in Cie . Industriali Riunite , an Italian holding company . \nFor the nine months , AT&T said net income was $ 1.99 billion , or $ 1.85 a share , up 19 % from $ 1.67 billion , or $ 1.56 a share . \nRevenue gained 3.1 % to $ 26.81 billion from $ 26 billion . \nIn composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange , AT&T shares closed at $ 43.375 , up 87.5 cents . \nWhen it comes to buying and selling shares , Westridge Capital Management Inc. takes a back seat to no one . \nEvery dollar 's worth of stock in the Los Angeles money manager 's portfolio is traded seven or eight times a year , the firm estimates . \nThat makes it the most active trader among all the nation 's investment advisers , according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings . \nBut wait a second . \nWestridge Capital is an index fund -- the type of stolid long-term investor whose goal is to be nothing more than average . \nWestridge Capital 's frenetic trading reflects the changes sweeping through the previously sleepy world of indexing . \nIndexing for the most part has involved simply buying and then holding stocks in the correct mix to mirror a stock market barometer , such as Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , and match its performance . \nInstitutional investors have poured $ 210 billion into stock and bond indexing as a cheap and easy form of investment management that promises to post average market returns . \nThese big investors have flocked to indexing because relatively few `` active '' stock pickers have been able to consistently match the returns of the S&P 500 or other bellwethers , much less beat it . \nAnd the fees investors pay for indexing run a few pennies for each $ 100 of assets -- a fraction of the cost of active managers . \nThat 's because computers do most of the work , and low trading activity keeps a lid on commission costs . \nBut today , indexing is moving from a passive investment strategy to an increasingly active one . \nBecause index-fund managers are no longer satisfied with merely being average , they have developed `` enhanced '' indexing strategies that are intended to outperform the market as much as three percentage points . \n`` Indexing has been the most single successful investment concept in the last decade , but the index money has been just sort of sitting there , '' says Seth M. Lynn , president of Axe Core Investors Inc. , an indexer based in Tarrytown , N.Y . \n`` Now the interest is in what else can I do with that money . '' \nAmong the souped-up indexing strategies : Indexed portfolios can be built around thousands of stocks , or just a few dozen , rather than being restricted to the S&P 500 companies . \nThey can ignore the S&P 500 stocks altogether and focus on particular types of stocks , such as smaller companies , those paying high dividends or companies in a particular industry , state or country . \nWith today 's computer-driven program trading techniques , index funds can trade back and forth between stock-index futures and the actual stocks making up indexes such as the S&P 500 . \nFutures and options also make it possible to build `` synthetic '' index funds that do n't actually own a single share of stock , but can produce returns that match or exceed the broad stock market . \nOne reason for these hybrids is that indexing 's rapid growth is slowing , particularly for those `` plain vanilla '' funds that mirror the S&P 500 . \n`` There is n't a boatload -LCB- of big investors -RCB- out there still waiting to get into indexing , '' says P. James Kartalia , vice president of ANB Investment Management Co. , Chicago , which offers both indexing and active management services . \n-LRB- After tripling in size in the past five years , index funds now hold about 20 % of the stock owned by pension funds . -RRB- \nA further problem is razor-thin profits . \nPlain-vanilla funds have become so commonplace that fees they can charge have plunged to almost nothing , and in some cases are just that . \nTo land customers for their well-paying stock custodial business , big banks sometimes will throw in basic indexing services for free . \n`` It 's like getting a free toaster when you open an account , '' says Axe Core 's Mr. Lynn . \nAs a result , indexers have been looking for ways to give investors something more than the average for their money . \nAnd many have been successful , as in the case of the index fund operated by hyper-trader Westridge Capital . \nWestridge Capital has used enhanced indexing techniques to beat the S&P 500 's returns by 2.5 to 3 percentage points over the past four years , with the same risk level as holding the S&P 500 stocks , according to James Carder , the firm 's president . \nStrategies vary for Westridge Capital , which has $ 300 million under management . \nThe firm sometimes buys S&P 500 futures when they are selling at a discount to the actual stocks , and will switch back and forth between stocks and stock-index futures to take advantages of any momentary price discrepencies . \nMr. Carder also goes through periods when he buys stocks in conjunction with options to boost returns and protect against declines . \nAnd in some months , he buys stock-index futures and not stocks at all . \n`` By their nature , our trades are very short-term and are going to create high turnover , '' Mr. Carder adds . \n`` The more turnover , the better for our clients . '' \nBig indexer Bankers Trust Co. also uses futures in a strategy that on average has added one percentage point to its enhanced fund 's returns . \nJ. Thomas Allen , president of Pittsburgh-based Advanced Investment Management Inc. , agrees it 's a good idea to jump between the S&P 500 stocks and futures . \n`` You 're buying the S&P , and you always want to hold the cheapest form of it , '' he says . \nBut some indexers make little or no use of futures , saying that these instruments present added risks for investors . \n`` If the futures markets have a problem , then those products could have a problem , '' says John Zumbrunn , managing director of Prudential Insurance Co. of America 's Investment Index Technologies Inc. unit . \nPrudential currently is seeking approval to offer a new fund offering a return equal to the S&P 500 index plus 5\\/100 of a percentage point . \nAn added feature is that the slighty improved return would be guaranteed by Prudential . \nThere are many other strategies to bolster the returns of index funds . \nThey include : \nLIMITED RISK FUNDS : \nThese guarantee protection against stock market declines while still passing along most gains . \nHere a fund may promise to pay back , say , $ 95 of every $ 100 invested for a year , even if the market goes much lower . \nThe fund could invest $ 87 for one year in Treasury bills yielding 8 % to return the guaranteed $ 95 . \nThat leaves $ 13 , which could be used to buy S&P 500 options that will nearly match any gain in the S&P index . \nMANAGER REPLICATION FUNDS : \nSay a big investor is interested in growth stocks . \nInstead of hiring one of the many active managers specializing in growth stocks , indexers can design a portfolio around the same stocks ; the portfolio will be maintained by computer , reducing both fees and , in theory , risk -LRB- because of the large number of stocks -RRB- . \n`` We see a lot of interest in those kind of things , '' says Frank Salerno , a vice president of Bankers Trust . \n`` People comfortable with the passive approach are using them for other strategies . '' \nTILT FUNDS : \nThis is an index fund with a bet . \nInstead of replicating the S&P 500 or some other index exactly , some stocks are overweighted or underweighted in the portfolio . \nOne simple approach is to exclude S&P 500 companies considered bankruptcy candidates ; this can avoid weak sisters , but also can hurt when a company like Chrysler Corp. rebounds . \nAnother approach : An investor with $ 100 million might use $ 75 million to buy the S&P 500 index and spend the other $ 25 million on a favorite group of stocks . \nSPECIALIZED FUNDS : \nIndexes can be constructed to serve social goals , such as eliminating the stocks of companies doing business in South Africa . \nOther funds have been designed to concentrate on stocks in a geographic area in order to encourage local investment . \nPennsylvania State Employees Retirement System , for example , has about $ 130 million invested in a fund of 244 companies that are either Pennsylvania-based or have 25 % of their work forces in the state . \nShort interest on the New York Stock Exchange declined for the second consecutive month , this time 4.2 % , while the American Stock Exchange reported its third consecutive record month of short interest . \nThe Big Board reported that short interest dropped to 523,920,214 shares as of Oct. 13 from 547,347,585 shares in mid-September . \nAmex short interest climbed 3 % to 53,496,665 shares from 51,911,566 shares . \nFor the year-earlier month , the Big Board reported 461,539,056 shares , indicating a 13.5 % year-to-year rise , while the Amex reported 36,015,194 shares , a 48 % leap . \nAmex short interest has been heading upward since mid-December , with increases in each month since then except at mid-July . \nTraders who sell short borrow stock and sell it , betting that the stock 's price will decline and that they can buy the shares back later at a lower price for return to the lender . \nShort interest is the number of shares that have n't yet been purchased for return to lenders . \nAlthough a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock 's price will decline , some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be bought back . \nFluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging . \nThe figures occasionally include incomplete transactions in restricted stock . \nThe level of negative sentiment measured by the Big Board short interest ratio slipped to 3.36 from last month 's 3.38 . \nThe ratio is the number of trading days , at the exchange 's average trading volume , that would be required to convert the total short interest position . \nSome analysts suggest , however , that the ratio has weakened in value as an indicator because options and other products can be used to hedge short positions . \nVarity Corp. led the Big Board list of largest short volumes with 12,822,563 shares . \nVarity has proposed to acquire K-H Corp. , consisting of the auto parts division and some debt of Fruehauf Corp. , for $ 577.3 million of cash and securities . \nChemical Waste Management posted the biggest increase in short volume on the New York exchange , up 3,383,477 shares to 5,267,238 . \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. , the entity formed from the recent acquisition of Squibb Corp. by Bristol-Myers Co. , logged the largest volume decline , 7,592,988 shares , to 12,017,724 . \nShort interest in International Business Machines Corp. plunged to 1,425,035 shares from 2,387,226 shares a month earlier . \nAlso closely watched is Exxon Corp. , where short interest slid to 4,469,167 shares from 5,088,774 . \nOn a percentage basis , Germany Fund Inc. led the gainers , leaping to 67,972 shares from three shares . \nTransCanada PipeLines Ltd. led the percentage decliners , dropping to 59 shares from 183,467 . \nThe Amex short interest volume leader again was Texas Air Corp. , rising to 3,820,634 shares from 3,363,949 . \nBolar Pharmaceutical Co. posted the largest volume increase , 552,302 shares , to 2,157,656 . \nThe company is under an investigation concerning procedures to gain Food and Drug Administration approval of generic drugs . \nBolar has denied any wrongdoing . \nThe largest volume drop -- down 445,645 shares to 141,903 -- came in shares represented by B.A.T Industries PLC 's American depositary receipts . \nThe company is facing a takeover proposal from the financier Sir James Goldsmith . \nFirst Iberian Fund led the percentage increases , rising to 73,100 shares from 184 . \nNelson Holdings International Ltd. dropped the most on a percentage basis , to 1,000 shares from 255,923 . \nThe adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-October or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-September . \nYour Oct. 12 editorial `` Pitiful , Helpless Presidency ? '' correctly states that I was critical of the Bush administration 's failure to have any plan in place to respond in a timely fashion to the opportunities to oust Manuel Noriega presented by the attempted military coup on Oct. 3 . \nYou are absolutely wrong , however , in opining that this position is some kind of `` flip-flop , '' something newly arrived at as a result of reading the opinion polls . \nMy position is one founded on both the facts and the law . \nAlthough you may have forgotten , public opinion about Gen. Noriega is where it is in large measure because of my investigation of his years of involvement in narcotics smuggling -LRB- and simultaneous work as a U.S. operative -RRB- . \nThe public made up its mind about Gen. Noriega largely as a result of the hearings I chaired in the Subcommittee on Terrorism and Narcotics of the Foreign Relations Committee on Feb. 8 , 9 , 10 and 11 , 1988 , and again on April 4 , 1988 . \nIt was during those hearings that the nation first learned the breadth and depth of Gen. Noriega 's criminality , and of his enduring relationships with a variety of U.S. government agencies . \nThose hearings also highlighted how Gen. Noriega was able to use his relationships with these agencies to delay U.S. action against him , and to exploit the administration 's obsession with overthrowing the Sandinistas to protect his own drug-dealing . \nAs former Ambassador to Costa Rica Francis J. McNeil testified before the subcommittee , the Reagan administration knew that Gen. Noriega was involved with narcotics , but made a decision in the summer of 1986 `` to put Gen. Noriega on the shelf until Nicaragua was settled . '' \nAs the report issued by the subcommittee concluded , `` Our government did nothing regarding Gen. Noriega 's drug business and substantial criminal involvement because the first priority was the Contra war . \nThis decision resulted in at least some drugs entering the United States as a hidden cost of the war . '' \nUnfortunately , this problem continued even after Gen. Noriega 's indictment . \nThroughout 1988 and this year , I and others in Congress have pressed the U.S. to develop a plan for pushing this `` narcokleptocrat '' out of Panama . \nRegrettably , two administrations in a row have been unwilling and unable to develop any plan , military or economic , for supporting the Panamanian people in their attempts to restore democracy . \nSen. John Kerry -LRB- D. , Mass . -RRB- \nFor Vietnamese , these are tricky , often treacherous , times . \nAfter years of hesitation , economic and political reform was embraced at the end of 1986 , but ringing declarations have yet to be translated into much action . \nVietnam is finding that turning a stagnant socialist order into a dynamic free market does n't come easy . \nHere is how three Vietnamese are coping with change : \nThe Tire King \nNguyen Van Chan is living proof that old ways die hard . \nMr. Chan used to be an oddity in Hanoi : a private entrepreneur . \nHis business success made him an official target in pre-reform days . \nMr. Chan , now 64 years old , invented a fountain pen he and his family produced from plastic waste . \nLater , he marketed glue . \nBoth products were immensely popular . \nFor his troubles , Mr. Chan was jailed three times between 1960 and 1974 . \nThough his operation was registered and used only scrap , he was accused of conducting illegal business and possessing illegal materials . \nOnce he was held for three months without being charged . \nThings were supposed to change when Vietnam 's economic reforms gathered pace , and for awhile they did . \nAfter years of experimenting , Mr. Chan produced a heavy-duty bicycle tire that outlasted its state-produced rival . \nBy 1982 , he was selling thousands of tires . \nNewspapers published articles about him , and he was hailed as `` the tire king . '' \nHis efforts earned a gold medal at a national exhibition -- and attracted renewed attention from local authorities . \nDistrict police in 1983 descended on his suburban home , which he and his large family used as both residence and factory , and demanded proof the house and equipment were his . \nHe produced it . \n`` That was the first time they lost and I won , '' he says . \nHe was further questioned to determine if he was `` a real working man or an exploiter . '' \nSays Mr. Chan : `` When I showed it was from my own brain , they lost for the second time . '' \nBut a few days later the police accused him of stealing electricity , acquiring rubber without permission and buying stolen property . \nWarned he was to be jailed again , he fled to the countryside . \nHis family was given three hours to leave before the house and contents were confiscated . \nWith only the clothes they were wearing , family members moved to a home owned by one of Mr. Chan 's sons . \nAfter six months on the run , Mr. Chan learned the order for his arrest had been canceled . \nHe rejoined his family in January 1984 and began the long struggle for justice , pressing everyone from Hanoi municipal officials to National Assembly deputies for restoration of his rights . \nHe and his family kept afloat by repairing bicycles , selling fruit and doing odd jobs . \nMr. Chan achieved a breakthrough in 1987 -- and became a minor celebrity again -- when his story was published in a weekly newspaper . \nIn 1988 , 18 months after the sixth congress formally endorsed family-run private enterprise , district authorities allowed Mr. Chan to resume work . \nBy late last year he was invited back as `` the tire king '' to display his products at a national exhibition . \nNational leaders stopped by his stand to commend his achievements . \nMr. Chan now produces 1,000 bicycle and motorbike tires a month and 1,000 tins of tire-patching glue in the son 's small house . \nEighteen people pack the house 's two rooms -- the Chans , four of their 10 children with spouses , and eight of 22 grandchildren . \nMost sleep on the floor . \nCome daybreak , eight family members and two other workers unroll a sheet of raw rubber that covers the floor of the house and spills out onto the street . \nThe primitive operations also burst out the back door into a small courtyard , where an ancient press squeezes rubber solution into a flat strip and newly made tires are cooled in a bathtub filled with water . \nMr. Chan talks optimistically of expanding , maybe even moving into the import-export field . \nFirst , however , he has unfinished business . \nWhen district authorities allowed him to resume manufacturing , they released only one of his machines . \nThey did n't return the rubber stocks that represent his capital . \nNor did they return his house and contents , which he values at about $ 44,000 . \nHe wants to recover more than just his property , though . \n`` I want my dignity back , '' he says . \nThe Editor \nNguyen Ngoc seemed an obvious choice when the Vietnamese Writers Association was looking for a new editor to reform its weekly newspaper , Van Nghe . \nAfter the sixth congress , journalists seized the opportunity provided by the liberalization to probe previously taboo subjects . \nMr. Ngoc , 57 years old , had solid reformist credentials : He had lost his official position in the association in he early 1980s because he questioned the intrusion of politics into literature . \nAppointed editor in chief in July 1987 , Mr. Ngoc rapidly turned the staid Van Nghe into Vietnam 's hottest paper . \nCirculation soared as the weekly went way beyond standard literary themes to cover Vietnamese society and its ills . \nReaders were electrified by the paper 's audacity and appalled by the dark side of life it uncovered . \nOne article recounted a decade-long struggle by a wounded soldier to prove , officially , he was alive . \nAnother described how tax-collection officials in Thanh Hoa province one night stormed through homes and confiscated rice from starving villagers . \nThe newspaper also ran a series of controversial short stories by Nguyen Huy Thiep , a former history teacher , who stirred debate over his interpretation of Vietnamese culture and took a thinly veiled swipe at writers who had blocked his entry into their official association . \nVan Nghe quickly made influential enemies . \n`` Those who manage ideology and a large number of writers reacted badly '' to the restyled paper , says Lai Nguyen An , a literary critic . \nAfter months of internal rumblings , Mr. Ngoc was fired last December . \nHis dismissal triggered a furor among intellectuals that continues today . \n`` Under Mr. Ngoc , Van Nghe protected the people instead of the government , '' says Nguyen Duy , a poet who is the paper 's bureau chief for southern Vietnam . \n`` The paper reflected the truth . \nFor the leadership , that was too painful to bear . '' \nThe ` Billionaire ' \nNguyen Thi Thi is Vietnam 's entrepreneur of the 1980s . \nHer challenge is to keep her fledgling empire on top in the 1990s . \nMrs. Thi did n't wait for the reforms to get her start . \nShe charged ahead of the government and the law to establish Hochiminh City Food Co. as the biggest rice dealer in the country . \nHer success , which included alleviating an urban food shortage in the early 1980s , helped persuade Hanoi to take the reform path . \nHer story is becoming part of local folklore . \nA lifelong revolutionary with little education who fought both the French and the U.S.-backed Saigon regime , she switched effortlessly to commerce after the war . \nHer instincts were capitalistic , despite her background . \nAs she rode over regulations , only her friendship with party leaders , including Nguyen Van Linh , then Ho Chi Minh City party secretary , kept her out of jail . \nFollowing Mr. Linh 's appointment as secretary-general of the party at the sixth congress , Mrs. Thi has become the darling of `` doi moi '' , the Vietnamese version of perestroika . \nThe authorities have steered foreign reporters to her office to see an example of `` the new way of thinking . '' \nForeign publications have responded with articles declaring her Vietnam 's richest woman . \n`` Some people call me the communist billionaire , '' she has told visitors . \nActually , 67-year-old Mrs. Thi is about as poor as almost everyone else in this impoverished land . \nShe has indeed turned Hochiminh City Food into a budding conglomerate , but the company itself remains state-owned . \nShe manages it with the title of general-director . \nThe heart of the business is the purchase of rice and other commodities , such as corn and coffee , from farmers in the south , paying with fertilizer , farm tools and other items . \nLast year , Hochiminh City Food says it bought two million metric tons of unhusked rice , more than 10 % of the country 's output . \nThe company operates a fleet of trucks and boats to transport the commodities to its warehouses . \nA subsidiary company processes commodities into foods such as instant noodles that are sold with the rice through a vast retail network . \nIn recent years , Mrs. Thi has started to diversify the company , taking a 20 % stake in newly established , partly private Industrial and Commercial Bank , and setting up Saigon Petro , which owns and operates Vietnam 's first oil refinery . \nMrs. Thi says Hochiminh City Food last year increased pretax profit 60 % to the equivalent of about $ 2.7 million on sales of $ 150 million . \nShe expects both revenue and profit to gain this year . \nShe is almost cavalier about the possibility Vietnam 's reforms will create rivals on her home turf . \n`` I do n't mind the competition inside the country , '' she says . \n`` I am only afraid that with Vietnam 's poor-quality products we ca n't compete with neighboring countries . \nThe earthquake that hit the San Francisco Bay area is n't likely to result in wholesale downgrading of bond ratings , officials at the two major rating agencies said . \nStandard & Poor 's Corp. is reviewing debt issued by 12 California counties , and `` there are potential isolated problems , '' said Hyman Grossman , a managing director . \nThe agency is preparing a report , to be issued today , on the earthquake 's impact on the property- and casualty-insurance industry . \nThe only securities so far to be singled out are those issued by Bay View Federal Savings & Loan . \nMoody 's Investors Service Inc. said it is reviewing , with an eye toward a possible downgrade , the ratings on Bay View Federal bonds , long-term deposits and the preferred-stock rating of its parent company , Bay View Capital Corp . \nAs for property and casualty insurers , Moody 's said `` preliminary estimates suggest that losses should not have a significant impact on most insurers ' financial condition , '' but it `` raises concerns about potentially substantial risks '' longer-term . \n`` Losses from the earthquake are expected to be of similar magnitude to those of Hurricane Hugo , '' according to Moody 's . \nYour Oct. 5 editorial `` A Democratic Tax Cut '' contained an error . \nIn the third paragraph it referred to the senators seeking loophole suggestions from lobbyists for various sectors of the economy . \nAmong them , `` banana farmers . '' \nThe only significant commercial banana farmers in the U.S. are in Hawaii . \nThe Hawaii Banana Industry Association , to which nearly all of them belong , has no lobbyist . \nThomas V. Reese Sr . Maui Banana Co . \nWestern Digital Corp. reported a net loss of $ 2.7 million , or nine cents a share , for its first quarter ended Sept. 30 , citing factors as varied as hurricane damage , an advance in graphics technology and the strengthening dollar . \nIn the year-ago period , the company earned $ 12.9 million , or 45 cents a share , on sales of $ 247 million . \nSales for the just-ended period fell to about $ 225 million , the maker of computer parts said . \nNonetheless , Chairman Roger W. Johnson said he expects the company to be profitable in the current quarter . \n`` We are positioned to come through , '' he said , noting that the company 's backlog was up from the previous quarter . \nIn its second quarter last year , Western Digital earned $ 12.7 million , or 44 cents a share , on sales of $ 258.4 million . \nMr. Johnson said Western Digital 's plant in Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Hugo , losing three days ' production because of the storm , which wrecked much of the Caribbean island 's infrastructure . \nAlthough the plant itself was n't damaged , Mr. Johnson said millions of dollars in first-quarter revenue were lost . \nThe revenue will be regained in the current period , he added . \nThere are no plans to initiate a common stock dividend , Mr. Johnson said , explaining that the board continues to believe shareholders are best served by reinvesting excess cash . \nMr. Johnson said the first-quarter loss also heavily reflected a rapid change in graphics technology that left reseller channels with too many of the old computer graphics boards and too few new monitors compatible with the new graphics boards . \nWestern Digital does n't make the monitors . \nAn accelerating move by personal computer manufacturers ' to include advanced graphics capabilities as standard equipment further dampened reseller purchases of Western Digital 's equipment . \n`` The other areas of the business -- storage and microcomputers -- were very good , '' Mr. Johnson said . \nHe said Western Digital has reacted swiftly to the movement to video graphics array , VGA , graphics technology from the old enhanced graphics adapter , EGA , which has a lower resolution standard , technology and now is one of the leading producers of these newer units . \nOther makers of video controller equipment also were caught in the EGA-VGA shift , he said , `` but we were able to respond much more quickly . '' \nStill , Mr. Johnson said , `` our stock is grossly undervalued . '' \nHe said the company has cut operating expenses by about 10 % over the last few quarters , while maintaining research and development at about 8 % to 9 % of sales . \nAs part of its reorganization this week , Western Digital has divided its business into two segments -- storage products , including controllers and disk drives ; and microcomputer products , which include graphics , communications and peripheral control chips . \nGraphics , communications and peripheral control chips were combined because , increasingly , multiple functions are being governed by a single chip . \nStorage , which includes computer controllers and 3.5-inch disk drives , represents nearly two-thirds of the company 's business . \nDisk drives , which allow a computer to access its memory , generated 38 % more revenue in the most recent period compared with the fiscal first quarter a year earlier . \nComputer parts are getting ever smaller , Mr. Johnson said , a shrinking that has propelled laptops into position as the fastest-growing segment of the computer business . \nAs smaller and more powerful computers continue to be the focus of the industry , he said , Western Digital is strengthening development of laptop parts . \nNext year Western Digital plans to consolidate its operations from 11 buildings in Irvine into two buildings in the same city a new headquarters and , a block away , a modern $ 100 million silicon wafer fabrication plant . \nThe plan will help the company in its existing joint manufacturing agreement with AT&T . \nAbout half of Western Digital 's business is overseas , and Mr. Johnson expects that proportion to continue . \nPlans to dissolve many of the trade barriers within Europe in 1992 creates significant opportunities for the company , he said , particularly since Western Digital already manufactures there . \nCapitalizing on that presence , Western Digital is launching a major effort to develop the embryonic reseller market in Europe . \nDirectors of state-owned Banca Nazionale del Lavoro approved a two-step capital-boosting transaction and a change in the bank 's rules that will help it operate more like a private-sector institution . \nUntil now , BNL 's top managers and its directors have been appointed by a Treasury decree . \nBut under the bank 's proposed statutes , an assembly of shareholders must approve board members . \nThe bank 's chairman and director general , who also sit on the board , still would be appointed by the Treasury . \nBNL , which is controlled by the Italian Treasury , was rocked by the disclosure last month that its Atlanta branch extended more than $ 3 billion in unauthorized credits to Iraq . \nThe ensuing scandal , in which the bank 's management resigned , has helped renew calls for privatization , or at least an overhaul , of Italy 's banking system , which is about 80 % state-controlled . \nIn a related move , the bank also proposed that board representation be linked more closely to the bank 's new shareholding structure . \nBNL called a shareholders ' assembly meeting in December to vote on the proposals . \nBNL has about 75,000 nonvoting shares that are listed on the Milan Stock Exchange . \nThe shares were suspended from trading following disclosure of the Atlanta scandal ; Consob , the stock exchange regulatory body , reportedly will decide soon whether to end the trading suspension . \nSwitzerland 's wholesale price index increased 0.3 % in September from August , and was up 3.9 % from a year ago , marking the first time this year that the index has fallen below 4 % on a year-to-year basis , the government reported . \nThe government attributed the 0.3 % month-to-month rise in the index largely to higher energy prices . \nIn August , the index was up 0.2 % from the previous month , and was up 4.5 % on a year-to-year basis . \nThe wholesale price index , based on 1963 as 100 , was 180.9 in September . \nAmerican Express Co. posted a 21 % increase in third quarter net income despite a sharp rise in reserves for Third World loans at its banking unit . \nAided by a sharp gain in its travel business , American Express said net rose to $ 331.8 million , or 77 cents a share , from $ 273.9 million , or 64 cents a share . \nThe year-earlier figures included $ 9.9 million , or three cents a share , in income from discontinued operations . \nIncome from continuing operations was up 26 % . \nRevenue rose 24 % to $ 6.5 billion from $ 5.23 billion . \nThe travel , investment services , insurance and banking concern added $ 110 million to reserves for credit losses at its American Express Bank unit , boosting the reserve to $ 507 million as of Sept. 30 . \nThe bank 's Third World debt portfolio totals $ 560 million , down from $ 2.2 billion at the end of 1986 . \nThe bank charged off $ 53 million in loans during the quarter . \nAt the American Express Travel Related Services Co. unit , net rose 17 % to a record $ 240.8 million on a 19 % revenue increase . \nThe figures exclude businesses now organized as American Express Information Services Co . \nAmerican Express card charge volume rose 12 % . \nTravel sales rose 11 % , led by gains in the U.S. . \nAt IDS Financial Services , the financial planning and mutual fund unit , net rose 19 % to a record $ 47.6 million on a 33 % revenue gain . \nAssets owned or managed rose 20 % to $ 45 billion , and mutual fund sales rose 45 % in the quarter to $ 923 million . \nAmerican Express Bank earnings fell 50 % to $ 21.3 million from $ 42.5 million despite a 29 % revenue gain . \nThe results include $ 106 million of tax benefits associated with previous years ' Third World loan activity , compared with $ 15 million a year earlier . \nProfit rose 38 % at American Express Information Services to $ 21.6 million . \nShearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc. , as previously reported , had net of $ 65.9 million , reversing a $ 3.5 million loss a year earlier ; its latest results include a $ 37 million gain from the sale of an institutional money management business . \nAmerican Express 's share of Shearson 's earnings was $ 41 million , after preferred stock dividends ; it owns about 68 % of Shearson 's common . \nFor the nine months , American Express said net rose 11 % to $ 899.8 million , or $ 2.09 a share , from $ 807.5 million , or $ 1.89 a share . \nRevenue rose 24 % to $ 18.73 billion from $ 15.09 billion . \nTextron Inc. , hampered by a slowdown in its defense sales , reported an 8 % decline in per-share earnings on nearly flat revenue for its third quarter . \nThe aerospace and financial services concern said net income fell 5 % to $ 59.5 million from $ 62.8 million . \nRevenue of $ 1.73 billion was almost unchanged from last year 's $ 1.72 billion . \nPer-share net of 66 cents , down from 72 cents , fell by more than overall net because of more shares outstanding . \nThe company said that improved results in its financial-services sector were negated by increased costs in its government contract business , lower operating earnings in its commercial-products sector and soft automotive markets . \nNet was aided by a lower income tax rate . \nProfit before taxes fell 17 % to $ 84.4 million from $ 101.4 million . \nFor the nine months , Textron reported net of $ 182.1 million , or $ 2.06 a share , on revenue of $ 5.41 billion . \nA year ago , net was $ 170.4 million , or $ 1.93 a share , on revenue of $ 5.3 billion . \nThe nine-month results included a $ 9.5 million special charge in 1989 for an arbitration settlement related to past export sales , and $ 29.7 million in extraordinary charges in 1988 related to a former line of business and early redemption of debt . \nTextron said that nine-months ' results do n't include earnings of Avdel PLC , a British maker of industrial fasteners , but do include interest costs of $ 16.4 million on borrowings related to the proposed purchase of Avdel . \nA federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction against the purchase because of Federal Trade Commission concerns that the transaction would reduce competition in the production of two kinds of rivets . \nFor the quarter , Textron said aerospace revenue , including Bell helicopter and jet-engine manufacture , declined 9.8 % to $ 755.9 million from $ 838.3 million , an indication of slowing government defense work . \nAs the Hunt brothers ' personal bankruptcy cases sputter into their second year , Minpeco S.A. has proposed a deal to settle its huge claim against the troubled Texas oil men . \nBut the plan only threatens to heighten the tension and confusion already surrounding the cases that were filed in September 1988 . \nThe Peruvian mineral concern 's $ 251 million claim stems from 1988 jury award in a case stemming from the brothers ' alleged attempts to corner the 1979-80 silver market . \nMinpeco now says it is willing to settle for up to $ 65.7 million from each brother , although the actual amount would probably be much less . \nAlthough the proposal must be approved by federal Judge Harold C. Abramson , W. Herbert Hunt has agreed to the Peruvian mineral concern 's proposal . \nNelson Bunker Hunt is considering it , although his attorney says he wo n't do it if the proposal jeopardizes a tentative settlement he has reached with the Internal Revenue Service , which claims the brothers owe $ 1 billion in back taxes and is by far the biggest creditor in both cases . \nThe tentative agreement between the IRS and Nelson Bunker Hunt is awaiting U.S. Justice Department approval . \nUnder it , the former billionaire 's assets would be liquidated with the IRS getting 80 % of the proceeds and the rest being divided among other creditors , including Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , which is seeking repayment of a $ 36 million loan . \nA similiar proposal has been made in the W. Herbert Hunt case although he and the IRS are at odds over the size of the non-dischargable debt he would have to pay to the government from future earnings . \nIn both cases , Minpeco and Manufacturers Hanover have been fighting ferociously over their shares of the pie . \nWith support from the IRS , Manufacturers Hanover has filed suit asking Judge Abramson to subordinate Minpeco 's claim to those of Manufacturer Hanover and the IRS . \nMinpeco has threatened a `` volcano '' of litigation if the Manufacturers Hanover Corp. unit attempts to force such a plan through the court . \nMinpeco said it would n't pursue such litigation if its settlement plan in the W. Herbert Hunt case is approved by Judge Abramson , who will consider the proposal at a hearing next week . \nMinpeco attorney Thomas Gorman decribed the plan as one step toward an overall settlement of the W. Herbert Hunt case but Hugh Ray , attorney for Manufacturers Hanover , called it `` silly '' and said he would fight it in court . \n`` The thing is so fluid right now that there 's really no way to say what will happen , '' says Justice Department attorney Grover Hartt III , who represents the IRS in the case . \n`` Developments like this are hard to predict . \nBanc One Corp. said it agreed in principle to buy five branch offices from Trustcorp Inc. , Toledo , Ohio , following the planned merger of Trustcorp into Society Corp. , Cleveland . \nThe five offices in Erie and Ottawa counties in northern Ohio have total assets of about $ 88 million , Banc One said . \nThe purchase price will be established after Banc One has an opportunity to study the quality of the assets , Banc One said . \nSociety Corp. already has branches in the area , and selling the Trustcorp offices could avoid a problem with regulators over excessive concentration of banking in the two counties after the merger of Trustcorp into Society , according to industry sources . \nThe merger is scheduled to take place in the 1990 first quarter . \nStock-market fears and relatively more attractive interest rates pushed money-market mutual fund assets up $ 6.07 billion in the latest week , the sharpest increase in almost two years . \nThe 473 funds tracked by the Investment Company Institute , a Washington-based trade group , rose to $ 356.1 billion , a record . \nThe $ 6.07 billion increase was the strongest weekly inflow since January 1988 . \nThe increase was spread fairly evenly among all three types of funds . \nIndividual investors , represented in the general-purpose and broker-dealer fund categories , pulled money from the stock market after its big drop last Friday and put the money into funds , said Jacob Dreyer , vice president and chief economist of the Institute . \n`` Insitutional investors , on the other hand , reacted to the steep decline in yields on direct money-market instruments following the stock-market decline last Friday , '' Mr. Dreyer said . \nYields on money funds dropped in the week ended Tuesday , according to Donoghue 's Money Fund Report , a Holliston , Mass. , newsletter . \nThe average seven-day compounded yield fell to 8.55 % from 8.60 % the week earlier , Donoghue 's said . \nAt the auction of six-month U.S. Treasury bills on Monday , the average yield fell to 7.61 % from 7.82 % . \nLikewise , certificates of deposit on average posted lower yields in the week ended Tuesday . \nThe 142 institutional-type money funds rose $ 2.23 billion to $ 85.49 billion . \nThe 235 general-purpose funds increased $ 2.53 billion to $ 116.56 billion , while 96 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.3 billion to $ 154.05 billion . \nDomestic lending for real estate and property development was the source of Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd. 's most recent spate of financial troubles , the institution 's executive chairman , Mohamed Basir Ismail , said . \nSpeaking to reporters this week after Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders approved a rescue plan , Tan Sri Basir said heavy lending to the property sector rocked the bank when property prices in Malaysia plummeted in 1984-85 . \nHe said the bank could n't wait any longer for prices to recover and for borrowers to service their loans . \nSo the bank 's board decided to make 1.23 billion Malaysian dollars -LRB- US$ 457 million -RRB- in provisions for interest payments from loans previously recorded as revenue but never actually received by the bank , and to submit a bailout package to replenish the bank 's paid-up capital . \nThe predicament , he added , was similar to the Hong Kong 1982-83 property-price collapse , which exposed the involvement of Bank Bumiputra 's former subsidiary in the colony in the largest banking scandal in Malaysia 's history . \nThe subsidiary , Bumiputra Malaysia Finance Ltd. , was left with M$ 2.26 billion in bad loans made to Hong Kong property speculators . \nBoth episodes wiped out Bank Bumiputra 's shareholders ' funds . \nEach time , the bank 's 90 % shareholder -- Petroliam Nasional Bhd. , or Petronas , the national oil company -- has been called upon to rescue the institution . \nIn five years , Petronas , which became the dominant shareholder in a 1984 rescue exercise , has spent about M$ 3.5 billion to prop up the troubled bank . \nTan Sri Basir said the capital restructuring plan has been approved by Malaysia 's Capital Issues Committee and central bank . \nMalaysia 's High Court is expected to approve the plan . \nOnce the plan is approved , Tan Sri Basir said , most of Bank Bumiputra 's nonperforming loans will have been fully provided for and the bank will be on track to report a pretax profit of between M$ 160 million and M$ 170 million for the fiscal year ending March 31 . \nFor the previous financial year , the bank would have reported a pretax profit of M$ 168 million if it had n't made provisions for the nonperforming loans , he said . \nMalaysia 's Banking Secrecy Act prohibited the bank from identifying delinquent borrowers , said Tan Sri Basir . \nBut public documents indicate 10 % or more of the bank 's provisions were made for foregone interest on a M$ 200 million loan to Malaysia 's dominant political party , the United Malays National Organization , to build its convention and headquarters complex in Kuala Lumpur . \nThe loan to UMNO was made in September 1983 . \n`` We lent a lot of money all over the place , '' said Tan Sri Basir , who refused to discuss the bank 's outstanding loans to \nAs well as the M$ 1.23 billion in provisions announced on Oct. 6 , the restructuring package covers an additional M$ 450 million in provisions made in earlier years but never reflected in a reduction of the bank 's paid-up capital . \nAt the end of the exercise , the cash injection from Petronas will increase the bank 's paid-up capital to M$ 1.15 billion after virtually being wiped out by the new provisions . \nHeidi Ehman might have stepped from a recruiting poster for young Republicans . \nWhite , 24 years old , a singer in her church choir , she symbolizes a generation that gave its heart and its vote to Ronald Reagan . \n`` I felt kind of safe , '' she says . \nNo longer . \nWhen the Supreme Court opened the door this year to new restrictions on abortion , Ms. Ehman opened her mind to Democratic politics . \nThen a political novice , she stepped into a whirl of `` pro-choice '' marches , house parties and fund-raisers . \nNow she leads a grassroots abortion-rights campaign in Passaic County for pro-choice Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Florio . \n`` This is one where I cross party lines , '' she says , rejecting the anti-abortion stance of Rep. Florio 's opponent , Reagan-Republican Rep. James Courter . \n`` People my age thought it was n't going to be an issue . \nNow it has -- especially for people my age . '' \nPolls bear out this warning , but after a decade of increased Republican influence here , the new politics of abortion have contributed to a world turned upside down for Mr. Courter . \nUnless he closes the gap , Republicans risk losing not only the governorship but also the assembly next month . \nGoing into the 1990s , the GOP is paying a price for the same conservative social agenda that it used to torment Democrats in the past . \nThis change comes less from a shift in public opinion , which has n't changed much on abortion over the past decade , than in the boundaries of the debate . \nNew Jersey 's own highest court remains a liberal bulwark against major restrictions on abortion , but the U.S. Supreme Court ruling , Webster vs. Missouri , has engaged voters across the nation who had been insulated from the issue . \nBefore July , pro-choice voters could safely make political decisions without focusing narrowly on abortion . \nNow , the threat of further restrictions adds a new dimension , bringing an upsurge in political activity by abortion-rights forces . \nA recent pro-choice rally in Trenton drew thousands , and in a major reversal , Congress is defying a presidential veto and demanding that Medicaid abortions be permitted in cases of rape and incest . \n`` If Webster had n't happened , you would n't be here , '' Linda Bowker tells a reporter in the Trenton office of the National Organization for Women . \n`` We could have shouted from the rooftops about Courter ... and no one would have heard us . '' \nNew Jersey is a proving ground for this aggressive women's-rights movement this year . \nThe infusion of activists can bring a clash of cultures . \nIn Cherry Hill , the National Abortion Rights Action League , whose goal is to sign up 50,000 pro-choice voters , targets a union breakfast to build labor support for its cause . \nThe league organizers seem more a fit with a convention next door of young aerobics instructors in leotards than the beefy union leaders ; `` I wish I could go work out , '' says a slim activist . \nA labor chief speaks sardonically of having to `` man and woman '' Election Day phones . \nNo age group is more sensitive than younger voters , like Ms. Ehman . \nA year ago this fall , New Jersey voters under 30 favored George Bush by 56 % to 39 % over Michael Dukakis , according to a survey then by Rutgers University 's Eagleton Institute . \nA matching Eagleton-Newark Star Ledger poll last month showed a complete reversal . \nVoters in the same age group backed Democrat Florio 55 % to 29 % over Republican Courter . \nAbortion alone ca n't explain this shift , but New Jersey is a model of how so personal an issue can become a baseline of sorts in judging a candidate . \nBy a 2-to-1 ratio , voters appear more at ease with Mr. Florio 's stance on abortion , and polls indicate his lead widens when the candidates are specifically linked to the issue . \n`` The times are my times , '' says Mr. Florio . \nThe Camden County congressman still carries himself with a trademark `` I'm-coming-down-your-throat '' intensity , but at a pause in Newark 's Columbus Day parade recently , he was dancing with his wife in the middle of the avenue in the city 's old Italian-American ward . \nAfter losing by fewer than 1,800 votes in the 1981 governor 's race , he has prepared himself methodically for this moment , including deciding in recent years he could no longer support curbs on federal funding for Medicaid abortions . \n`` If you 're going to be consistent and say it is a constitutionally protected right , '' he asks , `` how are you going to say an upscale woman who can drive to the hospital or clinic in a nice car has a constitutional right and someone who is not in great shape financially does not ? '' \nMr. Courter , by comparison , seems a shadow of the confident hawk who defended Oliver North before national cameras at Iran-Contra hearings two years ago . \nLooking back , he says he erred by stating his `` personal '' opposition to abortion instead of assuring voters that he would n't impose his views on `` policy '' as governor . \nIt is a distinction that satisfies neither side in the debate . \n`` He does n't know himself , '' Kathy Stanwick of the Abortion Rights League says of Mr. Courter 's position . \nEven abortion opponents , however angry with Mr. Florio , ca n't hide their frustration with the Republican 's ambivalence . \n`` He does n't want to lead the people , '' says Richard Traynor , president of New Jersey Right to Life . \nMoreover , by stepping outside the state 's pro-choice tradition , Mr. Courter aggravates fears that he is too conservative as well on more pressing concerns such as auto insurance rates and the environment . \nHe hurt himself further this summer by bringing homosexual issues into the debate ; and by wavering on this issue and abortion , he has weakened his credibility in what is already a mean-spirited campaign on both sides . \nElected to Congress in 1978 , the 48-year-old Mr. Courter is part of a generation of young conservatives who were once very much in the lead of the rightward shift under Mr. Reagan . \nLike many of his colleagues , he did n't serve in Vietnam in the 1960s yet embraced a hawkish defense and foreign policy -- even voting against a 1984 resolution critical of the U.S. mining of Nicaraguan harbors . \nJack Kemp and the writers Irving Kristol and George Gilder were influences , and Mr. Courter 's own conservative credentials proved useful to the current New Jersey GOP governor , Thomas Kean , in the 1981 Republican primary here . \nThe same partnership is now crucial to Mr. Courter 's fortunes , but the abortion issue is only a reminder of the gap between his record and that of the more moderate , pro-choice Gov. Kean . \nWhile the Warren County congressman pursued an anti-government , anti-tax agenda in Washington , Gov. Kean was approving increased income and sales taxes at home and overseeing a near doubling in the size of New Jersey 's budget in his eight years in office . \nKean forces play down any differences with Mr. Courter , but this history makes it harder for the conservative to run against government . \nMr. Courter 's free-market plan to bring down auto insurance rates met criticism from Gov. Kean 's own insurance commissioner . \nMr. Courter is further hobbled by a record of votes opposed to government regulation on behalf of consumers . \nFluent in Spanish from his days in the Peace Corps , Mr. Courter actively courts minority voters but seems oddly over his head . \nHe is warm and polished before a Puerto Rican Congress in Asbury Park . \nYet minutes after promising to appoint Hispanics to high posts in state government , he is unable to say whether he has ever employed any in his congressional office . \n`` I do n't think we do now , '' he says . \n`` I think we did . '' \nAsked the same question after his appearance , Democrat Florio identifies a staff member by name and explains her whereabouts today . \nWhen he is presented with a poster celebrating the organization 's 20th anniversary , he recognizes a photograph of one of the founders and recalls time spent together in Camden . \nDetails and Camden are essential Florio . \nElected to Congress as a `` Watergate baby '' in 1974 , he ran for governor three years later . \nIn the opinion of many , he has n't stopped running since , even though he declined a rematch with Gov. Kean in 1985 . \nHis base in South Jersey and on the House Energy and Commerce Committee helped him sustain a network of political-action committees to preserve his edge . \nWith limited budgets for television in a high-priced market , Mr. Florio 's higher recognition than his rival is a major advantage . \nMore than ever , his pro-consumer and pro-environment record is in sync with the state . \nAuto insurance rates are soaring . \nA toxic-waste-dump fire destroyed part of an interstate highway this summer . \nIn Monmouth , an important swing area , Republican freeholders now run on a slogan promising to keep the county `` clean and green . '' \nMr. Florio savors this vindication , but at age 52 , the congressman is also a product of his times and losses . \nHe speaks for the death penalty as if reading from Exodus 21 ; to increase state revenue he focuses not on `` taxes '' but on `` audits '' to cut waste . \nHard-hitting consultants match ads with Mr. Courter 's team , and Mr. Florio retools himself as the lean , mean Democratic fighting machine of the 1990s . \nAppealing to a young audience , he scraps an old reference to Ozzie and Harriet and instead quotes the Grateful Dead . \nThe lyric chosen -- `` long strange night '' -- may be an apt footnote to television spots by both candidates intended to portray each other as a liar . \nThe Democratic lawmaker fits a pattern of younger reformers arising out of old machines , but his ties to Camden remain a sore point because of the county 's past corruption . \nHis campaign hierarchy is chosen from elsewhere in the state , and faced with criticism of a sweetheart bank investment , he has so far blunted the issue by donating the bulk of his profits to his alma mater , Trenton State College . \nMr. Florio 's forcefulness on the abortion issue after the Webster ruling divides some of his old constituency . \nPasquale Pignatelli , an unlikely but enthusiastic pipe major in an Essex County Irish bagpipe band , speaks sadly of Mr. Florio . \n`` I am a devout Catholic , '' says Mr. Pignatelli , a 40-year-old health officer . \n`` I ca n't support him because of abortion . '' \nBill Wames Sr. , 72 , is Catholic too , but unfazed by Mr. Florio 's stand on abortion . \nA security guard at a cargo terminal , he wears a Sons of Italy jacket and cap celebrating `` The US 1 Band . '' \n`` I still think the woman has the right to do with her body as she pleases , '' he says . \n`` If you want more opinions ask my wife . \nShe has lots of opinions . \nConsumer prices rose a surprisingly moderate 0.2 % in September , pushed up mostly by a jump in clothing costs , the Labor Department reported . \nEnergy costs , which drove wholesale prices up sharply during the month , continued to decline at the retail level , pulling down transportation and helping to ease housing costs . \nThe report was the brightest news the financial markets had seen since before the stock market plunged more than 190 points last Friday . \nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied on the news , closing 39.55 points higher at 2683.20 . \nBond prices also jumped as traders appeared to read the data as a sign that interest rates may fall . \nBut many economists were not nearly as jubilant . \nThe climb in wholesale energy prices is certain to push up retail energy prices in the next few months , they warned . \nThey also said the dollar is leveling off after a rise this summer that helped to reduce the prices of imported goods . \n`` I think inflation is going to pick up through the fall , '' said Joel Popkin , a specialist on inflation who runs an economic consulting firm here . \n`` It has been in what I would describe as a lull for the past several months . '' \n`` We 've had whopping declines in consumer energy prices in each of the past three months , and at the wholesale level those are fully behind us now , '' said Jay Woodworth , chief domestic economist at Bankers Trust Co. in New York . \nBecause wholesale energy prices shot up by a steep 6.5 % last month , many analysts expected energy prices to rise at the consumer level too . \nAs a result , many economists were expecting the consumer price index to increase significantly more than it did . \nBut retail energy prices declined 0.9 % in September . \nThough analysts say competition will probably hold down increases in retail energy prices , many expect some of the wholesale rise to be passed along to the consumer before the end of the year . \nStill , some analysts insisted that the worst of the inflation is behind . \n`` It increasingly appears that 1987-88 was a temporary inflation blip and not the beginning of a cyclical inflation problem , '' argued Edward Yardeni , chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in New York . \nIn both 1987 and 1988 , consumer prices rose 4.4 % . \nA run-up in world oil prices last winter sent consumer prices soaring at a 6.7 % annual rate in the first five months of this year , but the subsequent decline in energy prices has pulled the annual rate back down to 4.4 % . \nMr. Yardeni predicted that world business competition will continue to restrain prices . \n`` The bottom line is , it seems to me that the economic environment has become very , very competitve for a lot of businesses , '' he said . \n`` Back in 1987-88 , business was operating at fairly tight capacity , so businesses felt they could raise prices . '' \nNow , he said , a slowdown in economic activity has slackened demand . \nThe mild inflation figures renewed investors ' hopes that the Federal Reserve will ease its interest-rate stance . \nThe steep climb in producer prices reported last Friday fostered pessimism about lower interest rates and contributed to the stock market 's 6.9 % plunge that day . \nIn the past several days , however , the U.S. 's central bank has allowed a key interest rate to fall slightly to try to stabilize the markets . \nAnalysts say Fed policy makers have been wary of relaxing credit too much because they were still uncertain about the level of inflation in the economy . \nExcluding the volatile categories of energy and food -- leaving what some economists call the core inflation rate -- consumer prices still rose only 0.2 % in September . \nTransportation costs actually fell 0.5 % , and housing costs gained only 0.1 % . \nApparel prices rocketed up 1.7 % , but that was after three months of declines . \nMedical costs continued their steep ascent , rising 0.8 % after four consecutive months of 0.7 % increases . \nCar prices , another area that contributed to the steep rise in the wholesale index last month , still showed declines at the consumer level . \nThey dropped 0.4 % as dealers continued to offer rebates to attract customers . \nFood prices rose 0.2 % for the second month in a row , far slower than the monthly rises earlier in the year . \nSeparately , the Labor Department reported that average weekly earnings rose 0.3 % in September , after adjusting for inflation , following a 0.7 % decline in August . \nAll the numbers are adjusted for seasonal fluctuations . \nHere are the seasonally adjusted changes in the components of the Labor Department 's consumer price index for September . \nAfter watching interest in the sport plummet for years , the ski industry is trying to give itself a lift . \nAcross the country , resorts are using everything from fireworks to classical-music concerts to attract new customers . \nSome have built health spas , business centers and shopping villages so visitors have more to do than ski . \nAnd this week , the industry 's efforts will go national for the first time when it unveils a $ 7 million advertising campaign . \nSuch efforts -- unheard of only a few years ago -- are the latest attempts to revive the sagging $ 1.76 billion U.S. ski industry . \nSince the start of the decade , lift-ticket sales have grown only 3 % a year on average , compared with 16 % annual growth rates in the '60s and '70s . \nLast season , lift-ticket sales fell for the first time in seven years . \nBy some estimates , nearly a fourth of all U.S. ski areas have been forced to shut down since the early '80s . \nCompetition and mounting insurance and equipment costs have been the undoing of many resorts . \nBut another big problem has been the aging of baby boomers . \nSkiing , after all , has mainly been for the young and daring and many baby boomers have outgrown skiing or have too many family responsibilities to stick with the sport . \nIn its new ad campaign , created by D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. , Chicago , the ski industry is trying to change its image as a sport primarily for young white people . \nOne 60-second TV spot features a diverse group of skiers gracefully gliding down sun-drenched slopes : senior citizens , minorities , families with children -- even a blind skier . \n`` Ski school is great , '' cries out a tot , bundled in a snowsuit as he plows down a bunny slope . \n`` You 'll never know 'til you try , '' says a black skier . \n`` We used to show some hot-dog skier in his twenties or thirties going over the edge of a cliff , '' says Kathe Dillmann , a spokeswoman for the United Ski Industries Association , the trade group sponsoring the campaign . \nSki promotions have traditionally avoided the touchy issue of safety . \nBut the new commercials deal with it indirectly by showing a woman smiling as she tries to get up from a fall . \n`` We wanted to show it 's okay if you fall , '' says Ms. Dillmann . \n`` Most people think if you slip , you 'll wind up in a body cast . '' \nThe ad campaign represents an unusual spirit of cooperation among resorts and ski equipment makers ; normally , they only run ads hyping their own products and facilities . \nBut in these crunch times for the ski industry , some resorts , such as the Angel Fire , Red River and Taos ski areas in New Mexico , have even started shuttle-busing skiers to each other 's slopes and next year plan to sell tickets good for all local lifts . \nMany resorts also are focusing more on the service side of their business . \nSince 40 % of skiers are parents , many slopes are building nurseries , expanding ski schools and adding entertainment for kids . \nVail , Colo. , now has a playland that looks like an old mining town ; kids can ski through and pan for fool 's gold . \nFor $ 15 , they can enjoy their own nightly entertainment , with dinner , without mom and dad . \nA few years ago , parents usually had to hire a sitter or take turns skiing while one spouse stayed with the children . \n`` Most parents who had to go through that never came back , '' says Michael Shannon , president of Vail Associates Inc. , which owns and operates the Vail and nearby Beaver Creek resorts . \nTo make skiing more convenient for time-strapped visitors , several resorts are buying or starting their own travel agencies . \nIn one phone call , ski buffs can make hotel and restaurant reservations , buy lift tickets , rent ski equipment and sign up for lessons . \nAnd resorts are adding other amenities , such as pricey restaurants , health spas and vacation packages with a twist . \nDuring Winter Carnival week , for example , visitors at Sunday River in Maine can take a hot-air balloon ride . \n`` People these days want something else to do besides ski and sit in the bar , '' says Don Borgeson , executive director of Angel Fire , N.M. 's Chamber of Commerce . \nThe ski industry hopes to increase the number of skiers by 3.5 million to about 21.7 million in the next five years with its latest ads and promotions . \nBut some think that 's being overly optimistic . \nFor one thing , it may be tough to attract people because skiing is still expensive : a lift ticket can cost up to $ 35 a day and equipment prices are rising . \nAnd most vacationers still prefer a warm climate for their winter excursions . \nAn American Express Co. survey of its travel agents revealed that only 34 % believe their clients will pick a trip this winter based on the availability of winter sports , as opposed to 69 % who think that warm-weather sports will be the deciding factor . \n`` Even if they could bring in that many new skiers , I do n't know if -LCB- the industry -RCB- could handle that kind of an increase , '' says I. William Berry , editor and publisher of the Ski Industry Letter in Katonah , N.Y . \n`` Most people will come on the weekend , the slopes will be overcrowded and then these -LCB- new skiers -RCB- wo n't come back . \nThey did n't play the third game of the World Series on Tuesday night as scheduled , and they did n't play it on Wednesday or Thursday either . \nBut you knew that , did n't you ? \nThey are supposed to play the game next Tuesday , in Candlestick Park here . \nThe theory is that the stadium , damaged by Tuesday 's earthquake , will be repaired by then , and that people will be able to get there . \nLike just about everything else , that remains to be seen . \nAftershocks could intervene . \nBut , at least , the law of averages should have swung to the favorable side . \nIt may seem trivial to worry about the World Series amid the destruction to the Bay Area wrought by Tuesday 's quake , but the name of this column is `` On Sports , '' so I feel obliged to do so . \nYou might be interested to know that baseball , not survival , appeared to be the first thought of most of the crowd of 60,000-odd that had gathered at Candlestick at 5:04 p.m. Tuesday , a half-hour before game time , when the quake struck . \nAs soon as the tremor passed , many people spontaneously arose and cheered , as though it had been a novel kind of pre-game show . \nOne fan , seated several rows in front of the open , upper-deck auxiliary press section where I was stationed , faced the assembled newsies and laughingly shouted , `` We arranged that just for you guys ! '' \nI thought and , I 'm sure , others did : `` You should n't have bothered . '' \nI 'd slept through my only previous brush with natural disaster , a tornado 15 or so summers ago near Traverse City , Mich. , so I was unprepared for one reaction to such things : the urge to talk about them . \nPerhaps primed by the daily diet of radio and TV reporters thrusting microphones into people 's faces and asking how they `` feel '' about one calamity or another , fellow reporters and civilians who spied my press credential were eager to chat . \n`` It felt like I was on a station platform and a train went by , '' said one man , describing my own reaction . \nA women said she saw the park 's light standards sway . \nA man said he saw the upper rim undulate . \nI saw neither . \nDictates of good sense to the contrary not withstanding , the general inclination was to believe that the disturbance would be brief and that ball would be played . \n`` I was near the top of the stadium , and saw a steel girder bow six feet from where I sat , but I stayed put for 10 or 15 minutes , '' confessed a friend . \n`` I guess I thought , ` This is the World Series and I 'm not gon na wimp out ! ' '' \nHere in the Global Village , though , folks do not stay uninformed for long . \nElectrical power was out in still-daylighted Candlestick Park , but battery-operated radios and television sets were plentiful . \nWithin a few minutes , the true extent of the catastrophe was becoming clear . \nIts Richter Scale measurement was reported as 6.5 , then 6.9 , then 7.0 . \nA section of the Bay Bridge had collapsed , as had a part of Interstate Highway 880 in Oakland . \nPeople had died . \nAt 5:40 p.m. , scheduled game time having passed , some fans chanted `` Let 's Play Ball . '' \nNo longer innocent , they qualified as fools . \nThe stadium was ordered evacuated soon afterward ; the announcement , made over police bullhorns , cited the power outage , but it later was revealed that there also had been damage of the sort reported by my friend . \nOutside , I spotted two young men lugging blocks of concrete . \n`` Pieces of Candlestick , '' they said . \nThe crowd remained good natured , even bemused . \nTV reporters interviewed fans in the parking lots while , a few feet away , others watched the interviews on their portable TVs . \nThe only frenzy I saw was commercial : Booths selling World Series commemorative stamps and dated postmarks were besieged by fledgling speculators who saw future profit in the items . \nThe traffic jam out of the park was monumental . \nIt took me a half-hour to move 10 feet from my parking spot in an outer lot to an aisle , and an additional hour to reach an inner roadway a half-block away . \nThe six-mile trip to my airport hotel that had taken 20 minutes earlier in the day took more than three hours . \nAt my hotel , the Westin , power was out , some interior plaster had broken loose and there had been water damage , but little else . \nWith Garpian randomness , a hotel across the street , the Amfac , had been hit harder : A large sheet of its concrete facade and several window balconies were torn away . \nThe Westin staff had , kindly , set out lighted candles in the ballroom , prepared a cold-cuts buffet and passed around pillows and blankets . \nI fell asleep on the lobby floor , next to a man wearing a Chicago Cubs jacket . \nI expected him to say , `` I told you so , '' but he already was snoring . \nThe journalistic consensus was that the earthquake made the World Series seem unimportant . \nMy response was that sports rarely are important , only diverting , and the quake merely highlighted that fact . \nShould the rest of the Series be played at all ? \nSure . \nThe quake and baseball were n't related , unlike the massacre of athletes that attended the 1972 Olympics . \nThat heavily politicized event learned nothing from the horrifying experience , and seems doomed to repeat it . \nTwo ironies intrude . \nThis has been widely dubbed the BART Series , after the local subway line , and the Bay Bridge Series . \nFlags fly at half-staff for the death of Bart Giamatti , the late baseball commissioner , and now the Bay Bridge lies in ruins . \nA Series that was shaping up as the dullest since the one-sided Detroit-over-San Diego go of 1984 has become memorable in the least fortunate way . \nStill , its edge is lost . \nIt now will be played mostly for the record , and should be wrapped up as quickly as possible , without `` off '' days . \nAnd I will never again complain about a rainout . \nThe disarray in the junk-bond market that began last month with a credit crunch at Campeau Corp. has offered commercial banks a golden opportunity to play a greater role in financing billion-dollar takeovers . \nBut two big New York banks seem to have kicked those chances away , for the moment , with the embarrassing failure of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. to deliver $ 7.2 billion in bank financing for a leveraged buy-out of United Airlines parent UAL Corp . \nFor more than a decade , banks have been pressing Congress and banking regulators for expanded powers to act like securities firms in playing Wall Street 's lucrative takeover game , from giving mergers advice all the way to selling and trading high-yield junk bonds . \nThose expanded powers reached their zenith in July when Bankers Trust New York Corp. provided mergers advice , an equity investment and bank loans for the $ 3.65 billion leveraged buy-out of Northwest Airlines parent NWA Inc . \nOne of the major selling points used by Los Angeles financier Alfred Checchi in getting the takeover approved was that the deal did n't include any junk bonds . \nThat was seen as an advantage in lobbying airline employees and Washington regulators for approval of the contested takeover . \nAll $ 3.35 billion in debt for the deal was supplied by banks . \nCharles Nathan , co-head of mergers and acquisitions at Salomon Brothers Inc. , says it is natural for banks to try to expand beyond their bread-and-butter business of providing senior debt for buy-outs . \nBut the UAL collapse , he says , `` may tell you it 's not going to work that easily . '' \nDavid Batchelder , a mergers adviser in La Jolla , Calif. , who aided Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis on the bids which put both UAL and NWA in play as takeover candidates this year , says that banks have been `` preparing to play a larger and larger role in acquisition financing . '' \nMr. Batchelder says that in the past , banks would normally have loaned 65 % of a total buy-out price , with the loans secured by the target company 's assets . \nAnother 20 % of the borrowed funds would come from the sale to investors of junk bonds , which offer less security and typically carry higher yields than bank loans . \nMr. Checchi 's purchase of NWA , Mr. Batchelder notes , `` was probably the most aggressive to date , '' with bank debt at 85 % of the purchase price . \nBut Mr. Batchelder says that Citicorp 's `` failure to deliver '' on its promise to raise the UAL bank debt for a labor-management buy-out group `` is very distressing to potential users of a ` highly-confident ' letter from commercial banks . '' \nHis client , Mr. Davis , used just such a letter from Citicorp in pursuing UAL ; Citicorp later agreed to work with a competing UAL buy-out group . \nExecutives of Citicorp and Chase Manhattan declined to comment on either the UAL situation , or on the changing nature of banks ' role in financing takeovers . \nIn the wake of Campeau 's problems , prices of junk bonds tumbled , throwing into doubt the ability of corporate acquirers to finance large takeovers with the help of junk bond sales . \nMark Solow , senior managing director at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. , says the falloff in junk bonds may yet open new business opportunities to banks in structuring takeovers . \nBut he warns that banks will have `` to have enough discipline '' not to make loans that are too risky . \nIn fact , Manufacturers Hanover said in its third-quarter earnings report that fees from syndicating loans to other banks dropped 48 % , to $ 21 million . \n`` We did n't take part in a lot of deals because their credit quality was poor , '' says a bank spokesman . \nJames B. Lee , head of syndications and private placements at Chemical Banking Corp. , said he believes banks can still make a credible offer of one-stop shopping for takeover finance . \nAs evidence , he cites yesterday 's arrangement for the final financing of a $ 3 billion bid for American Medical International Inc. in which Chemical served as both the lead bank and an equity investor . \nBeyond the current weakness in the junk bond market , banks have another advantage over investment banks in financing contested takeovers . \nArthur Fleischer Jr. , a takeover lawyer at Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson , notes that `` a political and emotional bias '' has developed against junk bonds . \nOne hostile bidder who deliberately avoided using junk bonds was Paramount Communications Inc. in its initial offer to acquire Time Inc. for $ 10.7 billion , or $ 175 a share . \nA Paramount spokesman says that decision was based on the financial , not political , drawbacks of junk bonds . \nBut some observers believe Paramount Chairman Martin Davis wanted to avoid the possible taint of being perceived as a corporate raider in his controversial bid for Time . \nIn the end , Mr. Davis used junk bonds so that he could raise Paramount 's bid to $ 200 a share . \nSome Monday-morning quarterbacks said the initial lower bid , without junk bonds , was a factor in his losing the company . \nTime eluded Paramount by acquiring Warner Communications Inc . \nThe success of the NWA financing , and the failure of the UAL deal , also seem to highlight the important new role in takeover financing being played by Japanese banks . \nJapanese banks accounted for 50 % of the NWA bank debt , according to a report by Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner . \nBut it was broad-scale rejection by Japanese banks that helped seal the fate of the attempt to buy UAL . \nCiticorp and Chase are attempting to put together a new , lower bid . \nTakanori Mizuno , chief economist of the Institute for Financial Affairs Inc. , a Tokyo research center on finance and economics , says , `` The junk bond market became very jittery , and there 's a fear of a coming recession and the possible bankruptcy of LBO companies . \nHarley-Davidson Inc. filed suit in federal court here , alleging that a group that holds 6.2 % of its stock made `` false , deceptive and misleading '' statements in recent regulatory filings and public announcements . \nHarley-Davidson 's complaint claims that the group , led by investor Malcolm I. Glazer , violated securities laws by failing to disclose plans to purchase 15 % of the company 's shares outstanding and that when the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filing eventually was made , it did n't disclose the group 's alleged earlier violation of the so-called prior-notice requirements of the law . \nMr. Glazer could n't immediately be reached to comment . \nBut when Harley last week publicly questioned the legality of the group 's filing procedures , the Rochester , N.Y. , investor said `` we complied with every law , '' and he denied any wrongdoing . \nThe Glazer group said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in early October that it may seek a controlling interest in Harley-Davidson , or seek representation on the company 's board . \nHarley has said it does n't intend to be acquired by the Glazer group or any other party . \nInland Steel Industries Inc. , battered by lower volume and higher costs , posted a 75 % drop in third-quarter earnings . \nThe nation 's fourth-largest steelmaker earned $ 18.3 million , or 43 cents a share , compared with $ 61 million , or $ 1.70 a share , a year earlier , when the industry was enjoying peak demand and strong pricing . \nSales fell to $ 981.2 million from $ 1.02 billion . \nThe earnings also mark a significant drop from the second quarter 's $ 45.3 million or $ 1.25 a share . \nMoreover , the earnings were well below analysts ' expectations of about $ 1.16 a share . \nIn composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , Inland closed yesterday at $ 35.875 a share , down $ 1 . \nThe company attributed the earnings drop to lower volume related to seasonal demand and the soft consumer durable market , especially in the automotive sector . \nHowever , the company also lost orders because of prolonged labor talks in the second quarter . \nThird-quarter shipments slipped 7 % from the year-ago period , and 17 % from this year 's second quarter . \nProfit of steel shipped for the company 's steel segment slid to $ 26 a ton , from $ 66 a ton a year earlier and $ 57 a ton a quarter earlier . \nAnalysts noted that the disappointing results do n't reflect lower prices for steel products . \nCharles Bradford , an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets , said higher prices for galvanized and cold-rolled products offset lower prices for bar , hot-rolled and structural steel . \nStructural steel , which primarily serves the construction market , was especially hurt by a 15 % price drop , Mr. Bradford said . \nThe company said its integrated steel sector was also hurt by higher raw material , repair and maintenance , and labor costs . \nThe increased labor costs became effective Aug. 1 under terms of the four-year labor agreement with the United Steelworkers union . \nMeanwhile , the company 's service center segment , which saw operating profit drop to $ 11.5 million from $ 30.7 million a year ago , experienced much of the same demand and cost problems , as well as start-up costs associated with a coil processing facility in Chicago and an upgraded computer information system . \nInland Chairman Frank W. Luerssen said the company 's short-term outlook is `` clouded by uncertainties in the economy and financial markets . '' \nHowever , he noted that steel mill bookings are up from early summer levels , and that he expects the company to improve its cost performance in the fourth quarter . \nIn the first nine months , profit was $ 113 million , or $ 3.04 a share , on sales of $ 3.19 billion , compared with $ 204.5 million , or $ 5.76 a share , on sales of $ 3.03 billion , a year earlier . \nThe `` seismic '' activity of a financial market bears a resemblance to the seismic activity of the earth . \nWhen things are quiet -LRB- low volatility -RRB- , the structures on which markets stand can be relatively inefficient and still perform their functions adequately . \nHowever , when powerful forces start shaking the market 's structure , the more `` earthquake-resistant '' it is , the better its chance for survival . \nAmerica 's financial markets do not yet have all the required modern features required to make them fully `` aftershock-resistant . '' \nInvestors lack equal access to the markets ' trading arena and its information . \nThat structural lack is crucial because investors are the only source of market liquidity . \nAnd liquidity is what markets need to damp quakes and aftershocks . \nIn today 's markets , specialists -LRB- on the New York Stock Exchange -RRB- and `` upstairs '' market makers -LRB- in the over-the-counter market -RRB- are the only market participants allowed to play a direct role in the price-determination process . \nWhen they halt trading , all market liquidity is gone . \nAnd when any component of the market -- cash , futures or options -- loses liquidity , the price discovery system -LRB- the way prices are determined -RRB- becomes flawed or is lost entirely for a time . \nLast Friday the 13th -LRB- as well as two years ago this week -RRB- the markets became unlinked . \nWhen that happened , `` seismic '' tremors of fear -- much like the shock waves created by an earthquake -- coursed through the market and increased the market 's volatility . \nLack of important , needed information can cause fear . \nFear is the father of panic . \nPanic frequently results in irrational behavior . \nAnd in financial markets , irrational behavior is sometimes translated into catastrophe . \nWhen market tremors start , it is crucial that as much information about transaction prices and the supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at various prices -RRB- be made available to all , not just to market makers . \nBecause of a lack of information and access , many investors -- including the very ones whose buying power could restore stability and damp volatility -- are forced to stand on the sidelines when they are most needed , because of their ignorance of important market information . \nTo add aftershock-damping power to America 's markets , a modern , electronic trading system should be implemented that permits equal access to the trading arena -LRB- and the information that would automatically accompany such access -RRB- by investors -- particularly institutional investors . \nContrary to some opinions , the trading activities of specialists and other market makers do not provide liquidity to the market as a whole . \nWhat market makers provide is immediacy , a very valuable service . \nLiquidity is not a service . \nIt is a market attribute -- the ability to absorb selling orders without causing significant price changes in the absence of news . \nMarket makers buy what investors wish to sell ; their business is reselling these unwanted positions as quickly as possible to other investors , and at a profit . \nAs a result , while any one customer may purchase immediacy by selling to a market maker -LRB- which is micro-liquidity for the investor -RRB- , the market as a whole remains in the same circumstances it was before the transaction : The unwanted position is still an unwanted position ; only the identity of the seller has changed . \nIn fact it can be argued that increasing capital commitments by market makers -LRB- a result of some post-1987 crash studies -RRB- also increases market volatility , since the more securities are held by market makers at any given time , the more selling pressure is overhanging the market . \nIn an open electronic system , any investor wishing to pay for real-time access to the trading arena through a registered broker-dealer would be able to see the entire supply-demand curve -LRB- buy and sell orders at each price -RRB- entered by dealers and investors alike , and to enter and execute orders . \nCurrent quotations would reflect the combined financial judgment of all market participants -- not just those of intermediaries who become extremely risk-averse during times of crisis . \nInvestors and professionals alike would compete on the level playing field Congress sought and called a `` national market system '' -LRB- not yet achieved -RRB- almost 15 years ago when it passed the Securities Reform Act of 1975 . \nLast Friday 's market gyrations did not result in severe `` aftershocks . '' \nWere we smart or just lucky ? \nI 'm not certain . \nBut I am sure we need to maximize our `` earthquake '' protection by making certain that our market structures let investors add their mighty shock-damping power to our nation 's markets . \nMr. Peake is chairman of his own consulting company in Englewood , N.J . \nNOW YOU SEE IT , now you do n't . \nThe recession , that is . \nThe economy 's stutter steps leave investors wondering whether things are slowing down or speeding up . \nSo often are government statistics revised that they seem to resemble a spinning weather vane . \nFor the past seven years , investors have had the wind at their backs , in the form of a generally growing economy . \nSome may have forgotten -- and some younger ones may never have experienced -- what it 's like to invest during a recession . \nDifferent tactics are called for , as losing money becomes easier and making money becomes tougher . \nFor those investors who believe -- or fear -- that 1990 will be a recession year , many economists and money managers agree on steps that can be taken to lower the risks in a portfolio . \nIn a nutshell , pros advise investors who expect a slowdown to hold fewer stocks than usual and to favor shares of big companies in `` defensive '' industries . \nA heavy dose of cash is prescribed , along with a heavier-than-usual allotment to bonds -- preferably government bonds . \nIt 's tempting to think these defensive steps can be delayed until a recession is clearly at hand . \nBut that may not be possible , because recessions often take investors by surprise . \n`` They always seem to come a bit later than you expect . \nWhen they do hit , they hit fast , '' says David A. Wyss , chief financial economist at the Data Resources division of McGraw-Hill Inc . \nThough he himself does n't expect a recession soon , Mr. Wyss advises people who do that `` the best thing to be in is long that is , 20-year to 30-year Treasury bonds . '' \nThe reason is simple , Mr. Wyss says : `` Interest rates almost always decline during recession . '' \nAs surely as a seesaw tilts , falling interest rates force up the price of previously issued bonds . \nThey are worth more because they pay higher interest than newly issued bonds do . \nThat effect holds true for both short-term and long-term bonds . \nBut short-term bonds ca n't rise too much , because everyone knows they will be redeemed at a preset price fairly soon . \nLong-term bonds , with many years left before maturity , swing more widely in price . \nBut not just any bonds will do . \nCorporate bonds `` are usually not a good bet in a recession , '' Mr. Wyss says . \nAs times get tougher , investors fret about whether companies will have enough money to pay their debts . \nThis hurts the price of corporate bonds . \nAlso , he notes , `` most corporate bonds are callable . '' \nThat means that a corporation , after a specified amount of time has passed , can buy back its bonds by paying investors the face value -LRB- plus , in some cases , a sweetener -RRB- . \nWhen interest rates have dropped , it makes sense for corporations to do just that ; they then save on interest costs . \nBut the investors are left stranded with money to reinvest at a time when interest rates are puny . \nIf corporate bonds are bad in recessions , junk bonds are likely to be the worst of all . \nIt 's an `` absolute necessity '' to get out of junk bonds when a recession is in the offing , says Avner Arbel , professor of finance at Cornell University . \n`` Such bonds are very sensitive to the downside , and this could be a disaster . '' \nMunicipal bonds are generally a bit safer than corporate bonds in a recession , but not as safe as bonds issued by the federal government . \nDuring an economic slump , local tax revenues often go down , raising the risks associated with at least some municipals . \nAnd , like corporates , many municipal bonds are callable . \nBut a few experts , going against the consensus , do n't think bonds would help investors even if a recession is in the offing . \nOne of these is Jeffrey L. Beach , director of research for Underwood Neuhaus & Co. , a brokerage house in Houston , who thinks that `` we 're either in a recession or about to go into one . '' \nWhat 's more , he thinks this could be a nastier recession than usual : `` Once the downturn comes , it 's going to be very hard to reverse . '' \nInvestors , he advises , `` should be cautious , '' holding fewer stocks than usual and also shunning bonds . \nBecause he sees a `` 5 % to 6 % base rate of inflation in the economy , '' he doubts that interest rates will fall much any time soon . \nInstead , Mr. Beach says , investors `` probably should be carrying a very high level of cash , '' by which he means such so-called cash equivalents as money-market funds and Treasury bills . \nGreg Confair , president of Sigma Financial Inc. in Allentown , Pa. , also recommends that investors go heavily for cash . \nHe is n't sure a recession is coming , but says the other likely alternative -- reignited inflation -- is just as bad . \n`` This late in an expansion , '' the economy tends to veer off either into damaging inflation or into a recession , Mr. Confair says . \nThe Federal Reserve Board 's plan for a `` soft landing , '' he says , requires the Fed to navigate `` an ever-narrowing corridor . '' \nA soft landing is n't something that can be achieved once and for all , Mr. Confair adds . \nIt has to be engineered over and over again , month after month . \nHe believes that the task facing Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is so difficult that it resembles `` juggling a double-bladed ax and a buzz saw . '' \nAnd , in a sense , that 's the kind of task individuals face in deciding what to do about stocks -- the mainstay of most serious investors ' portfolios . \nIt comes down to a question of whether to try to `` time '' the market . \nFor people who can ride out market waves through good times and bad , stocks have been rewarding long-term investments . \nMost studies show that buy-and-hold investors historically have earned an annual return from stocks of 9 % to 10 % , including both dividends and price appreciation . \nThat 's well above what bonds or bank certificates have paid . \nMoreover , because no one knows for sure just when a recession is coming , some analysts think investors should n't even worry too much about timing . \n`` Trying to time the economy is a mistake , '' says David Katz , chief investment officer of Value Matrix Management Inc. in New York . \nMr. Katz notes that some economists have been predicting a recession for at least two years . \nInvestors who listened , and lightened up on stocks , `` have just hurt themselves , '' he says . \nMr. Katz adds that people who jump in and out of the stock market need to be right about 70 % of the time to beat a buy-and-hold strategy . \nFrequent trading runs up high commission costs . \nAnd the in-and-outer might miss the sudden spurts that account for much of the stock market 's gains over time . \nStill , few investors are able to sit tight when they are convinced a recession is coming . \nAfter all , in all five recessions since 1960 , stocks declined . \nAccording to Ned Davis , president of Ned Davis Research Inc. in Nokomis , Fla. , the average drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was about 21 % , and the decrease began an average of six months before a recession officially started . \nBy the time a recession is `` official '' -LRB- two consecutive quarters of declining gross national product -RRB- , much of the damage to stocks has already been done - and , in the typical case , the recession is already half over . \nAbout six months before a recession ends , stocks typically begin to rise again , as investors anticipate a recovery . \nThe average recession lasts about a year . \nUnfortunately , though , recessions vary enough in length so that the average ca n't reliably be used to guide investors in timing stock sales or purchases . \nBut whatever their advice about timing , none of these experts recommend jettisoning stocks entirely during a recession . \nFor the portion of an investor 's portfolio that stays in stocks , professionals have a number of suggestions . \nMr. Katz advocates issues with low price-earnings ratios -- that is , low prices in relation to the company 's earnings per share . \n`` Low P-E '' stocks , he says , vastly outperform others `` during a recession or bear market . '' \nIn good times , he says , they lag a bit , but overall they provide superior performance . \nProf. Arbel urges investors to discard stocks in small companies . \nSmall-company shares typically fall more than big-company stocks in a recession , he says . \nAnd in any case , he argues , stocks of small companies are `` almost as overpriced as they were Sept. 30 , 1987 , just before the crash . '' \nFor example , Mr. Arbel says , stocks of small companies are selling for about 19 times cash flow . \n-LRB- Cash flow , basically earnings plus depreciation , is one common gauge of a company 's financial health . -RRB- \nThat ratio is dangerously close to the ratio of 19.7 that prevailed before the 1987 stock-market crash , Mr. Arbel says . \nAnd it 's way above the ratio -LRB- 7.5 times cash flow -RRB- that bigger companies are selling for . \nAnother major trick in making a portfolio recession-resistant is choosing stocks in `` defensive '' industries . \nFood , tobacco , drugs and utilities are the classic examples . \nRecession or not , people still eat , smoke , and take medicine when they 're sick . \nGeorge Putnam III , editor of Turnaround Letter in Boston , offers one final tip for recession-wary investors . \n`` Keep some money available for opportunities , '' he says . \n`` If the recession does hit , there will be some great investment opportunities just when things seem the blackest . '' \nMr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . \nSome industry groups consistently weather the storm better than others . \nThe following shows the number of times these industries outperformed the Standard & Poor 's 500-Stock Index during the first six months of the past seven recessions . \nBond prices posted strong gains as investors went on a bargain hunt . \nBut while the overall market improved , the new-issue junk-bond market continued to count casualties , even as junk-bond prices rose . \nYesterday , Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. said it postponed a $ 220 million senior subordinated debenture offering by York International Corp . \nAnd Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. scrambled to restructure and improve the potential returns on a $ 475 million debenture offering by Chicago & North Western Acquisition Corp. that was still being negotiated late last night . \nThe issue by Chicago & North Western is one of the so-called good junk-bond offerings on the new-issue calendar . \nSome analysts said the restructuring of the railroad concern 's issue shows how tough it is for underwriters to sell even the junk bonds of a company considered to be a relatively good credit risk . \nSince last week 's junk-bond market debacle , many new issues of high-yield , high-risk corporate bonds have either been scaled back , delayed or dropped . \nOn Wednesday , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. had to slash the size of Continental Airlines ' junk-bond offering to $ 71 million from $ 150 million . \nSalomon Brothers Inc. has delayed Grand Union Co. 's $ 1.16 billion junk-bond offering while it restructures the transaction . \nLast week , the Grand Union offering was sweetened to include warrants that allow bondholders to acquire common stock . \nPrudential-Bache said the York issue was delayed because of market conditions . \n`` Everything is going through firehoops right now , and -LCB- Chicago & North Western -RCB- is no exception , '' said Mariel Clemensen , vice president , high-yield research , at Citicorp . \nPortfolio managers say sweeteners like equity kickers and stricter protective covenants may increasingly be required to sell junk-bond deals . \nDan Baldwin , managing director of high-yield investments at Chancellor Capital Management , said the Chicago & North Western offering was restructured in part because `` several large insurance buyers right now are demanding equity as part of the package . \nIf you 're going to take the risk in this market , you want something extra . '' \nMr. Baldwin likes the offering . \nBut several mutual-fund managers , nervous about the deteriorating quality of their junk-bond portfolios and shy about buying new issues , said they 're staying away from any junk security that is n't considered first rate for its class . \nWhile they consider the Chicago & North Western issue to be good , they do n't view it as the best . \nTo lure buyers to the Chicago & North Western bonds , portfolio managers said Donaldson Lufkin sweetened the transaction by offering the bonds with a resettable interest rate and a 10 % equity kicker . \nThe bonds are expected to have a 14 1\\/2 % coupon rate . \nThe equity arrangement apparently would allow bondholders to buy a total of 10 % of the stock of CNW Corp. , Chicago & North Western 's parent company . \nDonaldson Lufkin declined to comment on the restructuring . \nAccording to some analysts familiar with the negotiations , the 10 % of equity would come directly from Donaldson Lufkin and a fund affiliated with the investment bank Blackstone Group , which would reduce their CNW equity holdings by 5 % each . \nThat would leave the Blackstone fund with a 60 % stake and Donaldson Lufkin with 15 % . \nDespite the problems with new issues , high-yield bonds showed gains in the secondary , or resell , market . \nJunk bonds ended about one-half point higher with so-called high-quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership rising one point . \nIn the Treasury market , the benchmark 30-year bond rose seven-eighths point , or $ 8.75 for each $ 1,000 face amount . \nThe gain reflects fresh economic evidence that inflation is moderating while the economy slows . \nThat raised hopes that interest rates will continue to move lower . \nThe Labor Department reported that consumer prices rose just 0.2 % last month , slightly lower than some economists had expected . \nBut there were also rumors yesterday that several Japanese institutional investors were shifting their portfolios and buying long-term bonds while selling shorter-term Treasurys . \nShort-term Treasury securities ended narrowly mixed , with two-year notes posting slight declines while three-year notes were slightly higher . \nYesterday , the Fed executed four-day matched sales , a technical trading operation designed to drain reserves from the banking system . \nThe move was interpreted by some economists as a sign that the Fed does n't want the federal funds rate to move any lower than the 8 3\\/4 % at which it has been hovering around during the past week . \nThe closely watched funds rate is what banks charge each other on overnight loans . \nIt is considered an early signal of Fed credit policy changes . \n`` The fact that they did four-day matched sales means they are not in a mood to ease aggressively . \nThey are telling us that -LCB- 8 3\\/4 % -RCB- is as low as they want to see the fed funds rate , '' said Robert Chandross at Lloyds Bank PLC . \nTreasury Securities \nThe benchmark 30-year bond was quoted late at a price of 101 25\\/32 to yield 7.955 % , compared with 100 29\\/32 to yield 8.032 % Wednesday . \nThe latest 10-year notes were quoted late at 100 9\\/32 to yield 7.937 % , compared with 99 26\\/32 to yield 8.007 % . \nShort-term rates rose yesterday . \nThe discount rate on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.56 % from 7.51 % Wednesday , while the rate on six-month bills rose to 7.57 % from 7.53 % . \nMeanwhile , the Treasury sold $ 9.75 billion of 52-week bills yesterday . \nThe average yield on the bills was 7.35 % , down from 7.61 % at the previous 52-week bill auction Sept. 21 . \nYesterday 's yield was the lowest since 7.22 % on July 27 . \nHere are details of the auction : \nRates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value . \nThus , higher bidding narrows the investor 's return while lower bidding widens it . \nThe percentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year , while the coupon-equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year . \nCorporate Issues \nJunk bond price climbed yesterday despite skittishness in the new-issue market for high-yield securities . \nDealers said junk bond issues on average were up by 1\\/4 to 1\\/2 point with so-called quality issues from RJR Capital Holdings Corp. and Petrolane Gas Service Limited Partnership posting one-point gains . \nPetrolane Gas Service 's 13 1\\/4 % debentures traded at 102 , after trading around par earlier this week , and RJR 's 13 1\\/2 % subordinated debentures of 2001 were at 101 5\\/8 after trading at below par earlier this week . \nInvestment-grade bonds were unchanged . \nMunicipals \nActivity was brisk in the high-grade general obligation market , as a series of sell lists hit the Street and capped upward price movement in the sector . \nTraders estimated that more than $ 140 million of high-grade bonds was put up for sale via bid-wanted lists circulated by a handful of major brokers . \nThere was speculation that the supply was coming from a commercial bank 's portfolios . \nAccording to market participants , the bonds were met with decent bids , but the volume of paper left high grades in the 10-year and under maturity range unchanged to 0.05 percentage point higher in yield . \nAway from the general obligation sector , activity was modest . \nLong dollar bonds were flat to up 3\\/8 point . \nNew Jersey Turnpike Authority 's 7.20 % issue of 2018 was up 3\\/8 at 98 3\\/8 bid to yield about 7.32 % , down 0.03 percentage point . \nThe debt of some California issuers pulled off lows reached after Tuesday 's massive earthquake , although traders said market participants remained cautious . \nCalifornia expects to rely on federal emergency funds and its $ 1.06 billion in general fund reserves to meet the estimated $ 500 million to $ 1 billion in damages resulting from the quake , according to a state official . \nIt 's also unclear precisely how the state will rebuild its reserve , said Cindy Katz , assistant director of California 's department of finance , although she noted that a bond offering for that purpose is n't anticipated . \nMeanwhile , new issuance was slow . \nThe largest sale in the competitive arena was a $ 55.7 million issue of school financing bonds from the Virginia Public School Authority . \nA balance of $ 25.8 million remained in late order-taking , according to the lead manager . \nMortgage-Backed Securities \nMortgage securities generally ended 6\\/32 to 9\\/32 point higher , but lagged gains in the Treasury market because of a shift in the shape of the Treasury yield curve and rumored mortgage sales by thrifts . \nPremium Government National Mortgage Association securities with coupon rates of 13 % and higher actually declined amid concerns about increased prepayments because of a plan being considered by Congress to speed the refinancing of government-subsidized mortgages . \nGinnie Mae 13 % securities were down about 1\\/4 at 109 30\\/32 . \nIf the refinancing plan clears Congress , there could be fairly heavy prepayments on the premium securities , hurting any investor paying much above par for them . \nIn the current-coupon sector , a shift in the Treasury yield curve resulting from the better performance of long-dated issues over short-dated securities hurt major coupons because it will become more difficult to structure new derivative securities offerings . \nGinnie Mae 9 % securities ended at 98 6\\/32 , up 9\\/32 , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. 9 % securities were at 97 10\\/32 , up 6\\/32 . \nThe Ginnie Mae 9 % issue was yielding 9.42 % to a 12-year average life assumption , as the spread above the Treasury 10-year note widened 0.03 percentage point to 1.48 . \nWhile Remic issuance may slow in the coming days because of the shift in the Treasury yield curve , underwriters continued to crank out new real estate mortgage investment conduits structured when the yield curve was more favorable . \nTwo new Remics totaling $ 900 million were announced by Freddie Mac yesterday . \nForeign Bonds \nBritish government bonds ended little changed as investors awaited an economic policy address last night by Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson . \nThe Treasury 11 3\\/4 % bond due 2003\\/2007 was down 2\\/32 at 111 29\\/32 to yield 10.09 % , while the 11 3\\/4 % notes due 1991 were unchanged at 98 19\\/32 to yield 12.94 % . \nIn Japan , the bellwether No. 111 4.6 % bond of 1998 ended off 0.03 at 95.72 , to yield 5.32 % , and in West Germany , the 7 % benchmark issue due October 1999 ended 0.05 point lower at 99.85 to yield 7.02 % . \nTHE PANHANDLER approaches , makes his pitch . \nIt may be straightforward -- he wants money for food -- or incredibly convoluted ; his sister is at this very moment near death in Hoboken , he has lost his wallet and has only $ 1.22 in change to put toward a bus ticket costing $ 3.83 , and wo n't you give him the difference ? \nNo ? \nWell , how about a loan , he 'll take your name and address ... \nFiguring that their money would more likely go toward a bottle of Night Train Express , most people have little trouble saying no to propositions like this . \nBut healthy skepticism vanishes when they are solicited by an organized charity to help fight cancer , famine , child abuse , or what have you . \nMost see little reason to doubt that their cash will go toward these noble goals . \nBut will it ? \nIn a distressing number of cases , no . \nIn fact , the donors sometimes might be better off giving the money to the panhandler : at least he has no overhead , and he might even be telling the truth . \nLast year , more than $ 100 billion was donated to the nation 's 400,000 charities . \nWhile the vast bulk of it was indeed spent by reputable organizations on the good works it was raised for , it 's equally true that a sizable hunk was consumed in `` expenses '' claimed by other operators , including fraudulent expenses . \nIn many cases the costs claimed were so high that only a dribble of cash was left for the purported beneficiaries . \nIt 's impossible to say exactly how much of the total charity intake is devoured by stratospheric fund-raising costs , high-living operators , and downright fraud . \nBut the problem clearly is widespread and persistent . \nState law enforcers can barely keep up with charity scams , and reports from watchdog groups such as the Council of Better Business Bureaus are not encouraging . \nThe Philanthropic Advisory Service of the BBB reviews hundreds of new charities every year , measuring them against minimum standards for accountability ; for accuracy and honesty in solicitation ; and for percentage of funds actually going to work for which the charity was supposedly established . \nThe Service figures at least half of the money taken in should be spent on program . \nRoughly a third of the charities reviewed flunk the test . \nWhich , it should be added , does n't prevent the charities from raking in a lot of money anyway . \nWithout a microscope and a subpoena , it 's often hard to sort out worthwhile causes from ripoffs if all you 've got to go on is the solicitation itself . \nOn this basis , `` there 's no way the average person can know a good charity from a bad one , '' says David Ormstedt , an assistant attorney general in Connecticut . \n`` A lot of donors just get taken . '' \nIncluding those , he contends , who put about $ 1 million into the kitty for the Connecticut Association of Concerned Veterans and the Vietnam Veterans Service Center . \nThe state has sued these charities in state court , complaining that much of the money was grossly misspent ; 82 % , says Mr. Ormstedt , went to fund raisers and most of the rest to the people who ran the charities and to their relatives -- for fur coats , trips to Florida , Lucullan restaurant tabs . \nThe telephone number for the charity in Shelton , Conn. , has been disconnected , and the former officials could n't be located . \nRunning a charity does cost money , but reputable organizations manage to get the lion 's share of donations out to where they are really needed . \nThe Arthritis Foundation , the American Cancer Society and the United Way of America all say that they spend roughly 90 % of their income on programs , not overhead . \nWith some other charities , however , it s the other way around . \nThe fledgling National Children 's Cancer Society , for example , took in $ 2.5 million last year to finance bone-marrow transplants for children . \nBy the time it paid its expenses it only had $ 120,000 left -- not enough to treat even one child . \nThe state of Illinois is suing the charity for fraud in Chicago , along with Telesystems Marketing Inc. , its Houston-based fund raiser . \nBoth deny wrongdoing . \nThe charity admits spending a lot on fund raising , but says that was necessary to establish a donor base it can tap at much lower cost in years to come . \nMichael Burns , president of Telesystems , says his concern has only benefited from the publicity surrounding the case , noting that three other charities have signed on as clients because they were impressed with the amount he raised for National Children 's . \nMeanwhile , a state court judge has allowed the charity to go on soliciting funds . \nEnforcers ca n't put charities out of business simply because they spend the lion 's share of their income on fund raising . \nState laws previously used as a yardstick minimum percentages of income -- usually half -- that had to be spent on the program rather than overhead , but these have been overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court . \nIt has ruled that such laws might work to stifle fund raising , which would amount to limiting the charities ' first-amendment right to freedom of expression . \nThis puts upon enforcers the burden of proving outright fraud or misrepresentation , and such actions have been brought against hundreds of charities recently . \nThe attorney general 's office in Connecticut alone has put seven of them out of business over the past couple of years , and the enforcement drive is continuing there and elsewhere . \nIn making cases , the authorities frequently zero in on alleged misrepresentations made by the charities ' fund raisers . \nIllinois , for instance , currently has under investigation 10 of the 30 companies drumming up funds for charities soliciting there . \nEnforcers pay special attention to operators using sweepstakes prizes as an additional inducement to give . \nAttorneys general in several states , including Illinois , are already suing Watson & Hughey Co. , an Alexandria , Va.-based outfit that they say has used deceptive sweepstakes ads to solicit donations for the American Heart Disease Foundation and the Cancer Fund of America . \nAccording to the Illinois attorney general 's suit , Watson & Hughey sent mailings indicating that recipients were guaranteed cash prizes , and could win up to an additional $ 1,000 on top of them , if they contributed as little as $ 7 . \nBut the total value of the prizes was only $ 5,000 and most `` winners '' will receive just 10 cents , according to the attorney general 's office . \nThe suit is still pending in Illinois state court . \nWatson & Hughey has denied the allegations in court ; officials decline to comment further . \nWhile they can target some of the most obvious miscreants , enforcers concede that they are only scratching the surface . \nThere are so many cunning ploys used by so many dubious operators , they say , that it is probably impossible to stop them all . \nOne maneuver : the `` public education '' gambit . \nThe solicitation material indicates that donations will go toward a campaign alerting and informing the public about some health or other issue . \nWhat it does n't say is that the entire `` campaign '' may be the fund-raising letter itself . \n`` All too often this will merely be a statement on the solicitation such as , ` Do n't smoke ! ' or ` Wear suntan lotion , ' `` says William Webster , attorney general of Missouri . \n`` By putting these pithy statements on the solicitations , hundreds of thousands of dollars are claimed to have been spent on education to consumers when in fact this represents the costs of sending the newsletters . '' \nMr. Webster cites a four-page mailing from the United Cancer Council that offers a chance to win $ 5,000 in gold bullion to those giving as little as $ 5 to cancer education . \n`` A few boilerplate warnings about cancer appear but that 's only two inches in all four pages . \nI think some people may believe they 're helping fund a massive TV and print campaign , but we could n't find that the charity does anything except write these letters , '' he says . \nOfficials at the Washington D.C.-based charity did n't return repeated phone calls . \nMany fly-by-night charities ride the coattails of the biggest , best-known and most reputable ones by adopting names similar to theirs . \nThe established charities are bothered by this but say they can do little about it . \n`` We ca n't police the many organizations that have sprung up in the last few years using part of our name . \nMost of them do n't last for long , but in the meantime all we can do is tell people they are n't connected with us , '' says a spokeswoman for the American Heart Association . \nAnd sometimes a reputable charity with a household name gets used and does n't even know it . \nA couple in Rockford , Ill. , raised $ 12,591 earlier this year using the name and logo of Mothers Against Drunk Driving , without permission from the group . \nMADD did n't learn of the fund raising until the couple sent it a check for $ 613 , along with a letter saying that was the charity 's `` share . '' \nThe Illinois Attorney General won a court order to prevent the couple from raising further funds without MADD 's permission . \nThe couple could n't be reached for comment and apparently have left Rockford , law enforcement officials report . \nDenise McDonald , a spokeswoman for MADD , says , `` It 's scary , because anybody could do this . '' \nMr. Johnson is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's Chicago bureau . \nOverhead costs at some of the largest charities , in millions of dollars \nBritish Airways PLC , a crucial participant in the proposed buy-out of UAL Corp. , washed its hands of the current efforts to revive a bid for the parent of United Airlines . \nSpecifically , the British carrier said it currently has no plans to participate in any new offer for UAL . \nIn addition , British Air officially withdrew its support for the previous $ 300-a-share bid in a terse statement that said `` the original deal is closed . '' \nCompany officials said later that British Airways believes its involvement in the UAL buy-out ended last Friday when the buy-out group , which also includes UAL 's management and pilot union , failed to obtain financing for the $ 6.79 billion transaction . \nThe carrier stopped short of saying it would n't at some point reconsider participating in any new bid for UAL . \nHowever , company officials said they plan to take `` no initiatives '' to resurrect the transaction , and `` are n't aware '' of any restructured bid in the making . \nCollectively , the statements raised questions about whether a new bid for UAL will ever get off the ground . \nThe transaction has had a series of setbacks since the financing problems became known last Friday , with no signs or statements from the buy-out group to indicate that any progress has taken place . \nHowever , in response to the British Air decision , United 's pilot union vowed to continue efforts to revive the buy-out . \nPilot union Chairman Frederick C. Dubinsky said advisers to UAL management and the union will begin meeting in New York today and will work through the weekend to devise a new proposal to present to UAL 's board `` at the earliest time possible . '' \nPilot union advisers appeared confident that a new bid could go forward even without British Air 's participation . \nUAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement . \nUAL Chairman Stephen M. Wolf , who is leading the management end of the buy-out , has n't provided investors with any assurances about the prospect of a new deal . \nIn another setback yesterday , United 's machinist union asked the Treasury Department to investigate whether certain aspects of the original buy-out proposal violated tax laws . \nIn an effort to derail the buy-out , the union has already called for investigations by the Securities and Exchange Commission , Transportation Department and Labor Department . \nBut there was one bright spot yesterday . \nThe United flight-attendants union agreed to negotiations that could lead to the flight attendants contributing concessions to a revived bid in exchange for an ownership stake . \nThe pilot union , the only one to support the buy-out thus far , said the flight attendants ' decision `` enforces our belief that an all-employee owned airline is practical and achievable . '' \nStill , without the assurance of British Airways ' financial backing , it will be tougher for the buy-out group to convince already-reluctant banks to make loan commitments for a revised bid , especially since British Air 's original investment represented 78 % of the cash equity contribution for the bid . \nUnder the previous plan , British Air would have received a 15 % stake in UAL in exchange for a $ 750 million equity investment , with a 75 % stake going to UAL employees and 10 % to UAL management . \nBritish Air officials said the airline 's chairman , Lord King , was concerned about news reports indicating that British Air might be willing to participate in a bid that included a lower purchase price and better investment terms for the British carrier . \nThe previous reports were based on remarks by British Air 's chief financial officer , Derek Stevens , who said any revised bid would have to include a lower purchase price to reflect the sharp drop in UAL 's stock in the past week . \nUAL stock dropped $ 1.625 yesterday to $ 190.125 on volume of 923,500 shares in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange . \nUAL declined to comment on British Air 's statement . \nIn an interview Wednesday with Dow Jones Professional Investor Report , Mr. Stevens said , `` We 're in no way committed to a deal going through at all . \nWe 're not rushing into anything . \nWe do n't want to be party to a second rejection . '' \nIndeed , British Air seemed to be distancing itself from the troubled transaction early in an effort to avoid any further embarrassment . \nThe original transaction fell through on the same day British Air shareholders approved the plan at a special meeting after the British succeeded in arranging the financing for its equity contribution . \nThe carrier also seemed eager to place blame on its American counterparts . \n`` The -LCB- buy-out -RCB- consortium ceased to exist because our American partners were not capable of organizing the financing , '' a British Air spokesman said . \nBritish Airways may have begun to have second thoughts about the transaction after the Transportation Department forced Northwest 's Airlines ' new owners to restructure the equity contribution of KLM Royal Dutch Airlines in that carrier . \nMost of the department 's statements since the Northwest transaction indicated it planned to curtail foreign ownership stakes in U.S. carriers . \nEven before British Air 's announcement , pilot union leaders had been meeting in Chicago yesterday to consider their options . \nThe leaders expressed support for trying to revive the bid following a briefing Wednesday by the union 's advisers , Lazard Freres & Co. and Paul , Weiss , Rifkind Wharton & Garrison . \nThey also u",

            "message": "nanimously re-elected Mr. Dubinsky , the union chairman who has led the pilots ' 2 1\\/2-year fight to take control of the airline . \nUAL 's advisers have indicated previously that it may take a while to come forward with a revised plan since they want to have firm bank commitments before launching a new bid . \nThey have maintained that banks remain interested in financing the transaction . \nThe buy-out fell through after Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. , the lead banks in the transaction , failed to obtain $ 7.2 billion in financing needed for the plan . \nItaly 's industrial wholesale sales index rose 13.2 % in June from a year earlier , the state statistical institute Istat said . \nThe June increase compared with a rise of 10.5 % in May from a year earlier . \nDomestic wholesale sales rose 11.9 % from a year earlier , while foreign sales jumped 17.3 % , Istat said . \nFor the first six months , wholesale sales rose 12.3 % from the year before , reflecting to a 11.5 % jump in domestic sales and a 14.6 % boost in foreign sales . \nSales of capital goods to foreign and domestic destinations increased 16.6 % in the January-June period from a year earlier . \nSales of consumer goods rose 6.9 % in the same period , while sales of intermediate goods were up 13.8 % from a year ago . \nSenate Democrats favoring a cut in the capital-gains tax have decided , under pressure from their leaders , not to offer their own proposal , placing another obstacle in the path of President Bush 's legislative priority . \nA core group of six or so Democratic senators has been working behind the scenes to develop a proposal to reduce the tax on the gain from the sale of assets . \nThe plan was complete except for finishing touches , and there was talk that it would be unveiled as early as yesterday . \nBut Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- , a vigorous opponent of the capital-gains tax cut , called the group to meet with him Wednesday night and again yesterday . \nSen. Mitchell urged them to desist . \nAfterward , leaders of the dissident Democrats relented , and said they would n't offer their own proposal as they had planned . \nThe decision is a setback for President Bush , who needs the support of Democrats to pass the tax cut through the Democratic-controlled Senate . \nHaving a proposal sponsored by Democrats would have given the president an advantage . \nHaving only a Republican measure makes the task harder . \nStill , Sen. Bob Packwood -LRB- R. , Ore. -RRB- , the lead sponsor of the Republican capital-gains amendment , predicted that the tax cut would be enacted this year . \nHe said a clear majority of senators back the tax reduction and that ultimately there would be enough senators to overcome any procedural hurdle the Democratic leadership might erect . \nBut Sen. Mitchell , buoyed by his victory among fellow Democrats , strongly disagreed . \nMr. Mitchell has been predicting that the president 's initiative would fail this year . \nYesterday , in an interview , he added that the Democrats ' decision `` increases the likelihood that a capital-gains tax cut will not pass this year . '' \nMr. Mitchell 's first victory came last week , when the Senate passed a deficit-reduction bill that did n't contain a capital-gains provision . \nThat vote made it unlikely that a capital-gains tax cut would be included in the final bill , now being drafted by House and Senate negotiators . \nThe House version of the bill does include the tax cut . \nNow Republican leaders are concentrating on attaching a capital-gains amendment to some other bill , perhaps a measure raising the federal borrowing limit or a second tax bill that would follow on the heels of the deficit-reduction legislation . \nTo help lay the groundwork for that fight , President Bush plans early next week to meet at the White House with some 20 Democratic senators who favor cutting the capital-gains tax or are undecided on the issue . \nThe president apparently will have only one bill to push , Sen. Packwood 's , and at least some of the dissident Democrats plan to support it . \n`` I may want to offer additional amendments to improve it when the bill comes to the floor , '' said Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , a leader of those Democrats . \nThe Packwood plan , as expected , would allow individuals to exclude from income 5 % of the gain from the sale of a capital asset held for more than one year . \nThe exclusion would rise five percentage points for each year the asset was held , until it reached a maximum of 35 % after seven years . \nThe exclusion would apply to assets sold after Oct. 1 . \nAs an alternative , taxpayers could chose to reduce their gains by an inflation index . \nFor corporations , the top tax rate on the sale of assets held for more than three years would be cut to 33 % from the current top rate of 34 % . \nThat rate would gradually decline to as little as 29 % for corporate assets held for 15 years . \nThe Packwood plan also would include a proposal , designed by Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB- , that would create new tax benefits for individual retirement accounts . \nThe Roth plan would create a new , non-deductible IRA from which money could be withdrawn tax-free not only for retirement , but also for the purchase of a first home , education expenses and medical expenses . \nCurrent IRAs could be rolled over into the new IRAs , but would be subject to tax though no penalty . \nWestmoreland Coal Co. , realizing benefits of a sustained effort to cut costs and boost productivity , reported sharply improved third-quarter results . \nThe producer and marketer of low-sulfur coal said net income for the quarter was $ 5.9 million , or 71 cents a share , on revenue of $ 145.4 million . \nFor the year-earlier period , the company reported a loss of $ 520,000 or six cents a share . \nIn the latest nine months , the company earned $ 8.5 million , or $ 1.03 a share . \nLast year 's net loss of $ 3,524,000 included a benefit of $ 1,640,000 from an accounting change . \nRevenue for the nine months rose to $ 449 million from $ 441.1 million . \nIn an interview , Pemberton Hutchinson , president and chief executive , cited several reasons for the improvement : higher employee productivity and `` good natural conditions '' in the mines , as well as lower costs for materials , administrative overhead and debt interest . \nIn the latest nine months , Mr. Hutchinson said , total coal sales rose to about 14.6 million tons from about 14.3 million tons a year earlier . \nIn addition , long-term debt has been trimmed to about $ 72 million from $ 96 million since Jan. 1 . \nHe predicted the debt ratio will improve further in coming quarters . \nWestmoreland 's strategy is to retain and expand its core business of mining and selling low-sulphur coal in the Appalachia region . \nThe operating territory includes coal terminals on the Ohio River and in Newport News , Va . \nWestmoreland exports about a fourth of its coal tonnage , including a significant amount of metallurgical coal produced by others that is used by steelmakers overseas . \nFor the past couple of years , Westmoreland has undertaken an aggressive streamlining of all aspects of its business . \nMarginal operations and assets have been sold . \nThe size of the company 's board has been reduced to eight directors from 13 . \nAbout 140 salaried management jobs and hundreds of hourly wage positions have been eliminated . \nEven perks have been reduced . \nFor example , the chief executive himself now pays 20 % of the cost of his health benefits ; the company used to pay 100 % . \n`` I think the ship is now righted , the bilges are pumped and we are on course , '' Mr. Hutchinson said of the restructuring program . \n`` Much of what we set out to do is completed . '' \nBut he cautioned that Westmoreland 's third quarter is typically better than the fourth , so investors `` should n't just multiply the third quarter by four '' and assume the same rate of improvement can be sustained . \nOne difference , he said , is that the fourth quarter has significantly fewer workdays because of holidays and the hunting season . \n`` I do n't want to give the impression that everybody can relax now , '' he said . \n`` We have to keep working at improving our core business to stay efficient . \nIt 's a process that never really ends . '' \nNevertheless , Mr. Hutchinson predicted that 1989 would be `` solidly profitable '' for Westmoreland and that 1990 would bring `` more of the same . '' \nFor all of 1988 , the company reported an after-tax operating loss of $ 134,000 on revenue of $ 593.5 million . \nAn accounting adjustment made net income $ 1.5 million , or 18 cents a share . \nIn a move that complements the company 's basic strategy , its Westmoreland Energy Inc. unit is developing four coal-fired cogeneration plants with a partner in Virginia . \nSome of the coal the plants buy will come from Westmoreland mines . \nMr. Hutchinson predicted that the unit 's contribution to company results in the 1990s `` will be exciting . '' \nHe said Westmoreland is looking at investment stakes in other cogeneration plants east of the Mississippi River . \nWestmoreland expects energy demand to grow annually in the 2.5 % range in the early 1990s . \n`` We see coal 's piece of the action growing , '' Mr. Hutchinson said . \n`` Coal prices , while not skyrocketing , will grow modestly in real terms , we think . \nChase Manhattan Corp. , after trying unsuccessfully to sell its interest in its lower Manhattan operations building , has exercised its option to purchase the 50-story office tower . \nChase had purchased an option to buy the building at One New York Plaza for an undisclosed sum from the late Sol Atlas as part of its original lease in 1970 . \nThe current transaction cost the bank approximately $ 140 million . \nOf that amount , $ 20 million was payment for the land underneath the building and the rest was for the building itself . \nThe building houses about 4,500 Chase workers , most of whom will be moved to downtown Brooklyn after the bank 's new back office center is completed in 1993 . \nThe move is part of Chase 's strategy to consolidate its back offices under one roof . \nThe headquarters is located a few blocks away at 1 Chase Manhattan Plaza . \nAs part of its decision to leave the building , Chase tried to sell its interest , along with the Atlas estate 's interest , shortly after the October 1987 stock market crash . \nChase Senior Vice President George Scandalios said the bank decided to exercise its option after bids fell short of expectations . \nHe said Chase and the Atlas estate were looking to sell the entire building for $ 400 million to $ 475 million , but did n't get an offer for more than $ 375 million . \nAs the building 's new owner , Chase will have its work cut out for it . \nChase is vacating 1.1 million square feet of space , and Salomon Brothers Inc. , whose headquarters is in the building , also plans to move shortly . \nIn addition , another major building tenant , Thomson McKinnon Inc. 's Thomson McKinnon Securities , likely will vacate the premises as part of its liquidation . \nNew York real estate brokerage Edward S.

'' \n-LRB- Another much-beloved saying , however , this one in plain English , holds that if something walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , it is a duck . \nOn Oct. 29 , 1929 -- a date historians stubbornly insist on associating with the dreaded C-word -- the DJ industrials fell 12.8 % . \nIn the `` technical correction '' of two years ago , they lost a whopping 22.6 % . -RRB- \nCustomers hear a lot of this stuff from people who try to sell them stock . \nThese people used to be called brokers , but apparently this word either is not grandiose enough or carries too many negative connotations from the aforementioned technical correction , when terrified customers could n't raise brokers on the phone . \nEither way , the word `` broker '' is clearly out of favor . \nOf the major New York-based securities firms , only Morgan Stanley & Co. still calls its salespeople brokers . \nAt Merrill Lynch & Co. and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , they are `` financial consultants . '' \nAt Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , Prudential Bache Securities , and Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , they are `` account executives . '' \nAt PaineWebber Inc. , they are `` investment executives . '' \nSuch titles are designed to convey a sense of dignified , broad-scale competence and expertise in selling today 's myriad financial products . \nIt is a competence and expertise that some brokers themselves , overwhelmed by all the new things being dreamed up for them to peddle , do n't feel . \n`` It s almost product de jour , '' grouses one account executive at Dean Witter . \nThe transmogrified brokers never let the C-word cross their lips , instead stressing such terms as `` safe , '' `` insured '' and `` guaranteed '' -- even though these terms may be severely limited in their application to a particular new financial product . \nThe names of some of these products do n't suggest the risk involved in buying them , either . \nA case in point : `` government-plus '' bond funds . \nWhat could imply more safety than investing in government bonds ? \nWhat could be better than getting a tad more income from them -LRB- the plus -RRB- than other people ? \nIndeed , conservative investors , many of them elderly , have poured more than $ 50 billion into such funds , which promise fatter yields than ordinary Treasury bonds -- only to learn later that these funds use part of their money to dabble in high-risk bond options , a gambler 's game . \nWhen a certain class of investment performs so poorly that its reputation is tarnished , look for Wall Street to give it a new moniker . \nThis seems to be happening now to limited partnerships , many of which either have gone into the tank in recent years or have otherwise been grievous disappointments . \nThey are still being sold , but more and more often as `` direct investments '' -- with all the same risks they had under the old label . \nIn such cases , the game has n't changed , only the name . \nIn others a familiar old name still prevails , but the underlying game has changed . \nFor example , `` no load '' mutual funds remain a favorite with investors because they do n't carry a frontend sales commission . \nGetting out of them , however , may be a different story now . \nTraditional no-loads made their money by charging an annual management fee , usually a modest one ; they imposed no other fees , and many still do n't . \nIn recent years , though , a passel of others flying the no-load flag have been imposing hefty charges -- all the way up to 6 % -- when an investor sells his shares . \nShould n't they properly be called exit-load funds ? \nThe mutual-fund industry is debating the question , but do n't expect a new name while the old one is working so well . \nAnd do n't expect anyone to change the term `` blue chip , '' either , even though some of the companies that still enjoy the title may be riskier investments than they were . \nAmerican Telephone & Telegraph Co. , for one , is still a favorite of widows , orphans and trust departments -- but shorn of its regional telephone units and exposed to competition on every side , it is a far different investment prospect than it was before divestiture . \nAlso , blue chips in general have suffered much more short-term price volatility in recent years . \nLarry Biehl , a money manager in San Mateo , Calif. , blames that on the advent of program trading , in which computers used by big institutional investors are programmed to buy and sell big blocks when certain market conditions prevail . \nBlue chips , he says , `` are now being referred to as poker chips . '' \nFinally , even the time-honored strategy called `` value investing '' no longer means what it once did . \nBefore the takeover mania of the '80s , it referred to rooting out through analysis undervalued stocks , especially those with shrewd management , sound fundamentals and decent prospects . \nNow , says Mr. Biehl , value investing often means `` looking for downtrodden companies with terrible management that are in real trouble . '' \nTo institutional investors or brokers , he adds , a company with value is a company at risk of being swallowed up . \nMs. Bettner covers personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's Los Angeles bureau . \nI was amused to read your recent news stories on the banking industry 's reserve additions and concomitant threats to cease making new loans to less-developed countries . \nIf the whole story were told , it would read something like this : \n-- During the 1970s the commercial banks lured the country loan business away from the bond markets where the discipline of a prospectus and `` Use of Proceeds '' confirmation allowed lenders to audit expenditures of old loans before new loans were made . \n-- The reward for that reckless lending was high reported earnings -LRB- and management bonuses -RRB- ; the price , a sea of bad loans . \n-- For the past several years , the banks , lacking a private navy to enforce their interests , have been pressuring the U.S. Treasury to underwrite their bad LDC credits . \n-- The Treasury wisely has refused , but has concluded that indirect credit support through various multinational agencies should be made available for a price : either debt reduction or debt-service reduction or new loans -LRB- the Brady Plan -RRB- . \n-- The banks will threaten not to make further loans , but in truth , lacking the capital to write off their mistakes or to build a navy , they have no alternative but to go along . \nGeorge A. Wiegers \nGillette Co. elected Warren E. Buffett , chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. , to its board , increasing the number of directors to 12 from 11 . \nBerkshire Hathaway earlier this year bought $ 600 million of preferred stock in Gillette that is convertible into an 11 % stake , and Gillette said at the time that Mr. Buffett would be added to the board . \nSeparately , Gillette said its third-quarter earnings rose 2 % to $ 65.2 million , or 57 cents a share , from $ 63.9 million , or 57 cents a share , in the year-earlier period ; per-share earnings remained flat despite an increase in net income in part because the company paid a $ 10.4 million dividend on the new preferred stock in the period . \nSales rose 9 % to $ 921.6 million from $ 845.7 million , with sales of the company 's international\\/diversified operations `` well above '' the year earlier-period . \nFor the nine months , Gillette 's net income declined 1 % to $ 205.3 million , or $ 2.02 a share , from $ 207 million , or $ 1.82 a share , in the 1988 period . \nSales rose 6 % to $ 2.77 billion from $ 2.61 billion . \nIn composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , the company closed yesterday at $ 45.50 a share , up 25 cents . \nWhen Walter Yetnikoff , the president of Sony Corp. 's CBS Records , last month told producer Peter Guber that Sony was about to make a $ 3.4 billion bid for Columbia Pictures and needed someone to run the studio , Mr. Guber jumped at the chance . \nWithin two days , he was on his way to New York and Tokyo to meet with top brass at Sony . \nAnd before the week was out , Sony had offered Mr. Guber and his partner , Jon Peters , the most lucrative employment contracts in the history of the movie business . \nNot only that , Sony also agreed to give them a stake in Columbia 's future profits and buy their company , Guber Peters Entertainment Co. , for $ 200 million , almost 40 % more than the market value of the company . \nThere was just one sticking point : The two had a prior commitment . \nJust seven months earlier , they had signed a five-year exclusive contract to make movies for Warner Bros. for which they had just produced the smash hit `` Batman . '' \nBut Mr. Guber figured that Warner Communications Inc. chairman Steven Ross , would empathize and let the producers go , knowing the Sony offer was `` the culmination of a life 's work . '' \nHe figured wrong . \nLast week , following fruitless settlement talks , Warner , now merging with Time Inc. , filed a $ 1 billion breach of contract suit in Los Angeles Superior Court against both Sony and Guber Peters . \nSony promptly countersued , charging Warner with trying to sabotage its acquisitions and hurt its efforts to enter the U.S. movie business . \nThe accusations of lying and duplicity are flying thick and fast on both sides : As one Sony executive puts it , `` It 's World War III . '' \nThat two successful producers who are n't all that well known outside Hollywood could occasion such a clash of corporate titans suggests how desperate the quest for proven talent is in the movie business . \nAnd they are a very odd team in any case . \nMr. Guber was raised in Boston and educated in New York . \nHe is a lawyer with a string of academic degrees . \nMr. Peters is a high-school dropout who came to fame as Barbra Streisand 's hairdresser . \nYet , they are far and away the most prolific producers in Hollywood . \nAnd despite their share of duds , they make movies that make money . \nThat is a skill Sony badly needs -- and Warner is loath to lose . \nAlthough Columbia had a good summer with `` Ghostbusters II '' and `` When Harry Met Sally , '' rivals such as Warner , Paramount Pictures , Walt Disney Co. and Universal Studios have been thrashing Columbia at the box office . \nAfter five years of management turmoil , with four different studio heads , Columbia sorely needs a stable , savvy team to restore its credibility and get it back in the business of making hits . \nMr. Guber and Mr. Peters are n't universally loved in Hollywood but they are well connected . \nTheir stock in trade as `` executive producers '' is sniffing out hot properties , locking them up and then getting big studios to bankroll and distribute them . \nSometimes Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters do little more than grab the first draft of a screenplay for a `` Flashdance , '' or buy rights to a best seller such as `` The Color Purple . '' \nIt falls to others to do the writing , directing and producing . \nWith MGM\\/UA 's `` Rainman , '' for instance , Messrs. Guber and Peters had virtually nothing to do with day-to-day production , but their names still appear in big letters on the credits , and they are inevitably associated with its success . \nSometimes , as with `` Batman , '' the pair really do make the film . \nIn that case , Guber Peters acquired the rights in 1979 , nursed the movie through a dozen scripts , and were on the set in London for 11 months hovering over the most minute changes in casting and production . \n`` They 're the best production talent around , '' says Brian De Palma , beholden to Guber Peters for hiring him to direct the Warner movie of Tom Wolfe 's novel `` Bonfire of the Vanities . '' \nOn that film , which is to start shooting in a few months , `` they 've been very much involved , hiring talent and discussing the development of the script . \nAnd when you 're making a movie this big , you need all the help you can get , '' Mr. De Palma adds . \n`` I wish they were around 24 hours a day . '' \nAnd some movies seem to have been hurt by their inattention . \nWarner executives blame Mr. Guber 's and Mr. Peters 's lack of involvement in `` Caddyshack II '' for casting and production problems and the film 's ultimate dismal failure . \n`` We 've had a few bombs , '' admits Mr. Peters . \n`` But by and large this company has only been profitable . '' \nHe says his company 's prowess at packaging and marketing `` is why we 'll be good at Columbia . \nWe practically ran our own studio . '' \nLongtime Hollywood associates describe Mr. Guber as the intellectual powerhouse of the two , a man with a flair for deal-making and marketing . \n`` Peter is a major piece of Hollywood manpower who has really earned his success , '' says Robert Bookman , an agent at Creative Artists Agency . \nMark Johnson , the producer of `` Rainman , '' chimes in : `` He has a great ability to hire terrific people and delegate authority ... . \nIt 's no accident that they 've been able to develop such successful material . '' \nMr. Peters , on the other hand , has fewer fans in Hollywood , and his detractors like to characterize him as something of a hot-tempered bully . \nHe gets better reviews as a creative whiz , an enthusiast , an idea man . \nHe also had to fight harder for credibility than his partner did . \nBarbra Streisand made him famous . \nHe cut her hair . \nHe lived with her . \nHe came to produce her records and her movies -- `` A Star Is Born '' and `` The Main Event . '' \nThrice married but now single , Mr. Peters got plenty of ink last summer for an on-set romance with actress Kim Basinger during the making of `` Batman . '' \nMr. Guber , by contrast , has been married to one woman for more than 20 years . \nBut for all their intellectual and stylistic differences , they make the perfect `` good cop , bad cop '' team , Hollywood associates say . \n`` Peter is the bright , sympathetic guy when you 're doing a deal , '' says one agent . \n`` If there 's a problem , Peter disappears , and all of a sudden Jon shows up . '' \nMr. Guber and Mr. Peters rub many people in Hollywood the wrong way . \nProducers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , who shepherded `` Flashdance '' through several scripts and ultimately produced the movie , bristle when Messrs. Guber and Peters take credit for the film . \nSays Mr. Simpson : `` The script was unreadable . \nWe reinvented it . \nWe are the producers of that movie . \nThey got a small piece of the net profits and a screen credit '' as executive producers . \nWhen Roger Birnbaum , an executive who worked for Guber Peters in the early 1980s , left to take a job as head of production at the United Artists studio , they made him forfeit all credits and financial interest in the films he had helped develop , including `` Rainman '' and `` Batman . '' \nMr. Peters acknowledges that and says it 's not unlike the situation he and Mr. Guber are in with Warner . \n`` I was upset with Roger , I fumpered and schmumpered , '' says Mr. Peters . \n`` But he wanted to pursue his own dream , and he went . '' \nStill , Mr. Birnbaum says his relationship with Guber Peters was `` one of the most successful I 've had in Hollywood . '' \nThe two `` have a wonderful chemistry -- Jon is very impulsive , and Peter is very compulsive , '' adds Mr. Birnbaum , who is now head of production at News Corp. 's 20th Century Fox Film Co . \n`` Jon Peters will come barreling into a room , say he 's got a great idea , and be gone . \nPeter will take the kernel of that idea and make it grow into something specific ... . '' \nMr. Birnbaum recalls that Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters shifted into high gear a few years back upon learning that they had competition for the story of the murdered naturalist Dian Fossey , which became `` Gorillas in the Mist . '' \nHe says , `` Within a few weeks , we made deals with the government of Rwanda and everyone who had ever met or talked to Dian Fossey . \nI think Peter even made some deals with the gorillas . '' \nUniversal Studios was working on a competing film , but the studio and its producers ultimately agreed to co-produce the film with Guber Peters and Warner . \nMore recently , Guber Peters beat out a dozen other producers , reportedly including Robert Redford and Ted Turner , for rights to the life story of Chico Mendes , the murdered Brazilian union leader who fought developers in the Amazon rain forest . \nMessrs. Guber and Peters assiduously courted the man 's widow for months , showing her a tape of `` Gorillas in the Mist '' to impress her with the quality of their work . \nMoney helped , too . \nUltimately , they paid more than $ 1 million for the rights . \n-LRB- The sale caused a rift between the widow and some of her husband 's followers . \nSome of the money will go to the Chico Mendes Foundation , but it is n't earmarked for groups trying to save the rain forest . -RRB- \nIt 's hardly astonishing -LRB- given the men 's track record -RRB- that Sony wants Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters . \nBut it is puzzling to some Hollywood executives that Sony rushed to hire them without clearing up the Warner situation first . \nSome note that Sony might have saved itself some trouble by just hiring Mr. Guber and letting Mr. Peters stay on to fulfill the Warner contract . \nBut though `` people in town may ask why Guber needs Peters , it 's good to have a partner , and obviously the chemistry works , '' says Steven Tisch , a producer who once worked for Mr. Guber . \n`` This business is n't about personalities at the end of the day -- it s about whether the ink is red or black . \nIn the case of Peter and Jon , the ink has been very , very black . '' \nMr. Guber got his start in the movie business at Columbia two decades ago . \nRecruited from New York University 's MBA program , he rose within two years to head of production , overseeing such films as `` The Way We Were , '' `` Taxi Driver , '' `` Tommy '' and `` Shampoo . '' \nIn 1976 , he teamed up with record producer Neil Bogart in Casablanca Records and Filmworks -- later called Polygram Pictures -- where they produced such hits as as `` The Deep , '' and `` Midnight Express . '' \nIn 1980 , Mr. Guber got together with Mr. Peters , by then a successful producer in his own right , after the death of Mr. Bogart . \nWhile Guber Peters produced a number of hits for Warner and others , their record was n't always so impressive . \nAmong their clinkers were `` The Legend of Billie Jean , '' `` VisionQuest , '' `` Clue '' and `` Clan of the Cave Bear . '' \nAnd the failures make it possible for Warner in its current lawsuit to paint the producers as ingrates . \nThe studio says it stuck with them `` even in the early years when the creative partnership was not particularly profitable for Warner . '' \nMr. Guber replies that `` this is a Goliath , this Time Warner , trying to chew up two fellows who have done only well for them for a long period of time . '' \nMr. Guber and Mr. Peters maintain that executives at Warner have always known of their ambitions to run a major entertainment powerhouse , but that Warner never felt threatened until they linked up with Sony . \n`` From the beginning , -LCB- they -RCB- knew we had a goal and a dream , '' says Mr. Guber . \nOn a number of occasions , he adds , he tried to get Warner to buy Guber Peters outright . \n`` They always listened , but they never acted , '' Mr. Guber says . \nIn 1987 , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters contributed their company 's assets in exchange for a 28 % stake in Barris Entertainment , a small-fry TV production company controlled by Giant Industries Inc. Chairman Burt Sugarman . \nIn July a year later , Warner agreed to release the producers from their old contract when Messrs. Guber , Peters and Sugarman made a $ 100 million offer to buy 25 % of MGM\\/UA . \nMr. Guber and Mr. Peters planned to run the nearly dormant MGM studio , and the two even tried to interest Warner Bros . ' President Terry Semel in becoming a partner after he advised them on the deal . \nBut the MGM plan collapsed just two weeks later . \nMr. Guber and Mr. Peters say they got a look at the books and balked at the price . \nTheir relationship with Mr. Sugarman soured shortly thereafter . \nLast May , he sold his 24 % stake in Barris to a passive Australian investor and Barris was renamed Guber Peters Entertainment Co . \nMeanwhile , Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters had agreed to extend their Warner agreement with the new five-year exclusive contract . \nThe new deal was considered the most generous of its kind , both financially and in terms of creative freedom . \nBut it paled by comparison to what Sony was to offer last month : the chance , at last , to run a major studio , about $ 50 million in deferred compensation , up to 10 % of Columbia 's future cash flow , 8 % of the future appreciation of Columbia 's market value , and annual salaries of $ 2.7 million for each . \nThe producers ' 28 % share of publicly held Guber Peters would net them an additional $ 50 million . \nSony also agreed to indemnify the producers against any liability to Warner . \nSony is paying a hefty price for a company that had revenue of only $ 42 million last year . \nAnd earnings have been erratic . \nIn the the latest quarter , thanks in part to `` Batman , '' Guber Peters earned $ 5.8 million , or 50 cents a share , compared to a loss of $ 6.8 million , or 62 cents a share , in last year 's quarter . \nGuber Peters stock , which traded as low as $ 6 a share last year , closed yesterday at $ 16.625 . \nThe two sides now are accusing each other of lying . \nMr. Guber and Mr. Peters claim they have an oral agreement with Warner executives that allows them to terminate their contract should the opportunity to run a major studio arise . \nBut in affidavits filed yesterday in the Los Angeles court , Mr. Ross , Warner Bros. Chairman Robert Daly and President Semel deny that such an oral agreement was ever made . \nWarner , in its court filings , calls it `` a piece of fiction created for this litigation . '' \nMr. Daly in his affidavit acknowledges that Warner agreed to release the producers last year to take over MGM but says that situation was altogether different . \nFor one thing , according to Mr. Daly , the producers requested a release in advance . \nMoreover , the old contract was about to expire , and the lineup of Guber Peters pictures for Warner was n't as strong as it is now . \nWarner itself was in negotiations with MGM over certain movie and other rights , and it was `` in Warner 's interest to accommodate MGM\\/UA , Guber and Peters by permitting them to become MGM executives , '' Mr. Daly said in his affidavit . \nWarner obviously does n't think that it is in its own interests to let Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters go off to Columbia . \nAt the very least , Mr. Ross clearly sees an opportunity to use the two men to get a pound of flesh from Sony . \nDuring settlement talks , for example , Warner demanded such things as cable TV rights to Columbia movies and Columbia 's interest in the studio it jointly owns with Warner , according to executives involved in the talks . \nIn any settlement , Warner is almost certain to demand rights to most of the 50 or so projects Mr. Guber and Mr. Peters have locked up for the next few years , notably sequels to `` Batman . '' \nMr. Guber and Mr. Peters refuse to concede that they may have made a tactical error in accepting the Sony offer before taking it up with Warner . \nAnd they say there are plenty of precedents in Hollywood for letting people out of contracts . \nThe last time Columbia Pictures was looking for a studio chief , they note , Warner released producer David Puttnam from his contract , then took him back after he was subsequently fired by his bosses at Columbia . \nIn his affidavit filed yesterday , Warner 's Mr. Ross indicated he is n't buying any such argument : `` If Sony succeeds here , no written contract in Hollywood will be worth the paper it 's written on . \nTHE SALES PITCH could n't sound better . \nFirst , there 's the name : `` asset-backed securities . '' \nBetter than all those offers you get to buy securities backed by nothing . \nAnd there 's more . \nThe assets backing the securities come from some of the country 's biggest -- and most secure -- institutions . \nMost earn high ratings from credit agencies . \nTheir yields are higher than those of U.S. Treasury issues . \nAnd the booming market has already attracted many of the nation 's biggest institutional investors . \nReady to jump ? \nWell , think twice . \nThe concept may be simple : Take a bunch of loans , tie them up in one neat package , and sell pieces of the package to investors . \nBut the simplicity may be misleading . \nSkeptics say the slightly higher returns are n't enough to compensate for the extra risk . \nThey warn that asset-backed securities are only as good as the assets and credit backing that support them -- and those are hard to evaluate . \nMoreover , the securities were introduced only about 4 1\\/2 years ago ; the biggest unknown is how they will fare in a recession . \n`` A lot of this stuff really is in untested waters , '' says Owen Carney , director of the investment securities division of the U.S. comptroller of the currency . \n`` We do n't know how this whole market will work in a serious economic downturn . '' \nSuch concerns , however , have n't stopped asset-backed securities from becoming one of Wall Street 's hottest new products . \nSince the spring of 1985 , financial alchemists have transformed a wide variety of debt into these new securities . \nThey have sold issues backed by car loans , boat loans and recreational-vehicle loans . \nThey have offered bundles of homeequity loans , as well as packages of loans used to buy vacation time-shares . \nLast year , there was an issue of `` death-backed bonds '' -- securities backed by loans to life-insurance policyholders . \nSome predict there will be `` Third World bonds , '' backed by loans to Brazil , Argentina and other debt-ridden nations . \nAnd the biggest volume this year has been on securities backed by credit-card receivables , sometimes known as `` plastic bonds . '' \n`` This is the heyday of debt , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , a newsletter . \n`` Before the sun sets on the '80s , it seems nothing will be left unhocked . '' \nThe result is a $ 45 billion market , according to Securities Data Co . \nThat includes more than $ 9.5 billion issued through August of this year , up sharply from $ 6.5 billion in the comparable 1988 period -- and more than in all of 1987 . \nMost issues have been sold to professional money managers , pension funds , bank trust departments and other institutions . \nBut wealthy individuals also have been jumping in , and lately brokers have been pushing smaller investors into the asset-backed market . \nThe entry fee is affordable : Issues typically are sold in minimum denominations of $ 1,000 . \n`` We expect additional offerings '' of asset-backed securities targeted toward individual investors , says Bill Addiss , a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . \nThe process typically begins when an institution , such as Citibank or Sears , Roebuck & Co. , takes a pool of credit-card or other receivables and sells them to a specially created trust . \nThe trust then issues securities -- generally due in five years or less -- that are underwritten by Wall Street brokerage firms and offered to investors . \nIssues typically come with `` credit enhancements , '' such as a bank letter of credit , and thus have received high credit ratings . \nEnthusiasts say the booming market has opened up a valuable new source of funds to issuers , while providing a valuable new investment for individuals and institutions . \nAsset-backed securities `` are an attractive investment compared to bank certificates of deposit or other corporate bonds , '' says Craig J. Goldberg , managing director and head of the asset-backed securities group at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . \nBut skeptics question whether asset-backed bonds offer sufficient rewards to compensate for the extra risks . \nConsider a $ 500 million offering of 9 % securities issued last spring and backed by Citibank credit-card receivables . \nThe triple-A-rated issue offered a yield of only about 0.5 percentage point above four-year Treasury issues . \nOn a $ 10,000 investment , that 's a difference of only $ 50 a year . \nThat kind of spread can be critical for money managers who buy bonds in large quantities and whose livelihood depends on outperforming the money manager across the street . \nBut for individuals who buy much smaller amounts and care less about relative performance than in preserving what they have , that margin is meaningless . \n`` If you 're in the bond business playing the relative-performance derby , then even an extra 25 basis points -LRB- 0.25 percentage point -RRB- becomes an important consideration on a career basis , '' says Mr. Grant . \n`` But if you 're an individual investing money and trying to get it back again , then that is n't of overwhelming importance . '' \nMoreover , the interest on asset-backed securities is fully taxable , while interest on Treasury issues is tax-free at the state and local level . \nThat 's why some investment managers , such as Alex Powers , a vice president of Chase Manhattan Bank 's private banking division , do n't recommend most asset-backed issues for individuals in high-tax states , such as New York or California . \nBut Mr. Powers has purchased asset-backed issues for individuals with tax-deferred accounts , such as retirement plans . \nHe points out that institutions buying asset-backed issues in large quantities can earn higher spreads over Treasurys than individuals buying smaller amounts . \nAnother concern is liquidity , or how easily a security can be converted into cash . \nThe secondary , or resale , market for asset-backed securities is relatively new and much less active than for Treasury issues . \nThat could make it tricky for investors who need to sell their holdings quickly before the securities mature . \nThat 's particularly true , analysts say , for certain of the securities , such as those backed by time-share loans . \n`` You could see massive gyrations here because it 's such a thinly traded market , '' says Jonathan S. Paris , a vice president of European Investors Inc. , a New York investment-management firm . \nIn addition , an investor who wants to know the daily value of Treasury bonds , or corporate bonds traded on the New York Stock Exchange , can simply check newspaper listings . \nThere are n't any such listings for asset-backed securities . \nEvaluating asset-backed securities poses another problem . \nInvestors , for instance , may mistakenly assume that the bank or company that originally held the assets is guaranteeing the securities . \nIt is n't . \nThe front cover of the prospectus for the Citibank credit-card receivables offering points out in bold capital letters that the certificates represent an interest only in the specially created trust and `` do not represent interests in or obligations of the banks , Citibank N.A. , Citicorp or any affiliate thereof . '' \nIn other words , if there 's a problem , do n't expect Citibank to come to the rescue . \nThe prospectus also notes that the securities are not guaranteed by any government agency . \nThat means investors have to focus on the quality of the debt that lies beneath the securities , as well as on the credit enhancement for the issue and the credit ratings the issue has received . \nThat also is n't easy . \nTake the `` credit enhancements , '' which typically include a bank letter of credit or insurance from a bond-insurance company . \nThe letter of credit typically is not offered by the bank selling the assets to back the securities . \nNor does it cover the entire portfolio . \nDetails of credit enhancements vary widely from issue to issue . \nStill , they play a crucial role in winning top ratings for most asset-backed issues -- which in turn is why the yield above Treasurys is so slim . \nBut skeptics ask why you should bother buying this stuff when you can get only slightly lower yields on government-guaranteed paper . \nWhen you buy an asset-backed issue , you take the risk that a bank or an insurer could run into unexpected difficulties . \nIf a bank 's credit rating was lowered because of , say , its loans to Third World nations , that could also affect the ratings , liquidity and prices of the asset-backed issues that the bank supports . \nUnderwriters insist these issues are constructed to withstand extremely tough economic conditions . \nBut despite the credit enhancements , despite the high ratings , some money managers still worry that a recession could wreak havoc on the underlying assets . \nAt a time when Americans are leveraged to their eyeballs , asset-backed investors may be taking a heady gamble that consumers will be able to repay loans in hard times . \nAt the very least , a recession would prompt investors to buy the highest-quality bonds they can find -- that is , Treasurys . \nThat could widen the yield spread between Treasurys and asset-backed securities , as well as make it tougher to unload the latter . \nBut it could be much worse . \nSome analysts are especially wary of credit-card issues . \nFor one thing , credit-card loans are unsecured . \nIn addition , they fear that banks have been overeager to issue cards to the public -- giving cards to too many big spenders who will default during a recession . \n`` A day of reckoning is coming where we think the market will place a high premium on the highest-quality debt issues , and therefore we think the best debt investment is U.S. government bonds , '' says Craig Corcoran of Davis\\/Zweig Futures Inc. , an investment advisory firm . \nWhat about triple-A-rated asset-backed issues ? \n`` Nope , we still say to stick with Treasurys , '' Mr. Corcoran replies . \nRatings , he notes , `` are subject to change . '' \nAll this makes asset-backed securities seem too risky for many people . \nAnd it reminds Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. , a market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. , of what he calls `` DeVoe 's Unprovable but Highly Probable Theory No. 1 : \n`` More money has been lost reaching for yield than in all the stock speculations , scams and frauds of all time . '' \nMr. Herman is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . \nVolume of asset-backed securities issued annually \n\\* Principal amount \n\\*\\* As of August 30 \n\\* Principal amount \nSource : Securities Data Co . \nIF YOU FORCE financial planners to sum up their most important advice in a single sentence , it would probably be a one-word sentence : Diversify . \nJudging by a poll of Wall Street Journal readers conducted this summer by Erdos & Morgan Inc. , serious investors have taken that advice to heart . \nNearly 1,000 investors responded to the Journal 's poll , providing an in-depth look at their portfolios . \nThose portfolios are remarkably diversified . \nBy spreading their wealth among several investment alternatives , the respondents have protected themselves against squalls in any one area , be it stocks , bonds or real estate . \nFor example , about 88 % of Journal readers owned stock -LRB- down slightly from 91 % in a similar poll last year -RRB- . \nBut only 17.5 % said they had more than half their money in the stock market . \nSimilarly , 57 % of respondents own shares in a money-market mutual fund , and 33 % own municipal bonds . \nBut only 6 % to 7 % of the investors were committing more than half their funds to either of those alternatives . \nThe poll , conducted Aug. 7-28 , also provides a glimpse into the thinking of serious investors on a variety of other topics . \nIt found them in a cautious , but not downbeat , mood . \nOf 1,500 people sent a questionnaire , 951 replied . \nThe response rate , more than 63 % , allows the results to be interpreted with a high degree of confidence . \nThe results ca n't be extrapolated to all investors , though . \nJournal readers are relatively affluent , with a median household income of between $ 75,000 and $ 99,000 . \nNearly half of the respondents -LRB- 47 % -RRB- said their investment portfolio was worth $ 250,000 or more , and 17 % said it was worth $ 1 million or more . \nThe respondents were mildly optimistic about the economy and investment markets , but their collective judgments were a notch more sober than they were a year ago . \nFor example , 12 % of this year 's respondents said they expect a recession within 12 months . \nLast year , only 8 % were expecting a recession . \nAn additional 56 % of this year 's respondents expect the economy to slow down during the next 12 months . \nOnly 42 % of last year 's respondents anticipated slowing growth . \nApparently , the respondents do n't think that an economic slowdown would harm the major investment markets very much . \nA slim majority -LRB- 51 % -RRB- think stock prices will be higher in August 1990 than they were in August 1989 . \nTheir verdict on real estate is almost the same . \nSome 50 % expect real estate in their local area to increase in value over the next 12 months . \nBy contrast , only 32 % expect an increase in the price of gold . \nSince gold tends to soar when inflation is high , that finding suggests that people believe inflation remains under control . \nEven though only 12 % actually predicted a recession , many respondents were taking a better-safe-than sorry investment stance . \nNearly a third said they have made some portfolio changes to anticipate a possible recession . \nFor the most part , the changes were `` slight . '' \nThe two-thirds who have n't tried to make their portfolios more recession-resistant were split about evenly between investors who `` do n't believe in trying to predict the markets '' -LRB- about 31 % -RRB- and investors who `` do n't expect a recession '' -LRB- about 15 % -RRB- or are `` unsure if and when a recession might come '' -LRB- about 22 % -RRB- . \nA buy-and-hold approach to stocks continues to be the rule among respondents . \nMost own two to 10 stocks , and buy or sell no more than three times a year . \nSome 71 % had bought some stock in the past year ; only 57 % had sold any . \nBut the lurking shadow of 1987 's stock-market crash still seems dark . \nAbout 33 % considered another crash `` likely , '' while about 63 % said one is `` unlikely . '' \nThose percentages hardly changed from the previous year 's poll . \nAnd the respondents ' commitment to the stock market remains somewhat lighter than usual . \nAbout 60 % of them said they would `` ordinarily '' have at least 25 % of their money in stocks . \nBut as of August , only 50 % actually had stock-market investments of that size . \nMost stock-market indexes were hitting all-time highs at around the time of the poll . \nBut it appears that many Journal readers were taking that news as a sign to be cautious , rather than a signal to jump on the bandwagon . \nMr. Dorfman covers investing issues from The Wall Street Journal 's New York bureau . \nCanadian steel ingot production totaled 276,334 metric tons in the week ended Oct. 14 , down 5.3 % from the preceding week 's total of 291,890 tons , Statistics Canada , a federal agency , said . \nThe week 's total was down 7.1 % from 297,446 tons a year earlier . \nA metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds . \nThe cumulative total in 1989 was 12,283,217 tons , up 7.5 % from 11,429,243 tons a year earlier . \nHealth Care Property Investors Inc. said it acquired three long-term care facilities and one assisted-living facility in a purchase-and-lease transaction valued at $ 15 million . \nThe real estate investment trust said that it leased the three Florida facilities to National Health Care Affiliates Inc. of Buffalo , N.Y . \nHealth Care Property holds an interest in 139 facilities in 30 states . \nMoody 's Investors Service said it lowered its rating on about $ 75 million of this Chatsworth , Calif. , concern 's convertible subordinated debentures , due 2012 , to Caa from B2 . \nIt said the reduction reflects impaired business prospects and reduced financial flexibility caused by continuing losses at the maker of Winchester disk drives . \nVALLEY National Corp. -- \nMoody 's Investors Service Inc. said it lowered its rating on about $ 400 million of this bank holding company 's senior debt to B2 from Ba3 . \nMoody 's said it expects Valley National , of Phoenix , Ariz. , to make substantial further provisions against its real-estate portfolio , and that it continues to suffer from the high cost of carrying nonperforming assets , and from high loan-loss provisions . \nElectronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing U.S. companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage . \nThat was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an all-day conference on corporate electronic espionage . \n`` Hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from U.S. companies and share it with their own companies , '' said Noel D. Matchett , a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , Md . \nIt `` may well be '' that theft of business data is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as it is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms , said Michelle Van Cleave , the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs . \nThe conference was jointly sponsored by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association , a joint industry-government trade group . \nAny secret can be pirated , the experts said , if it is transmitted over the air . \nEven rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder . \nThey need only position themselves near a company 's satellite dish and wait . \n`` You can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time , '' Mr. Matchett said , adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet they wo n't get caught . '' \nThe only way to catch an electronic thief , he said , is to set him up with erroneous information . \nEven though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , the experts said . \nBy contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million this year on electronic security , and are expected to spend $ 1 billion by 1992 . \nAlready many foreign firms , especially banks , have their own cryptographers , conference speakers reported . \nStill , encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy . \nOne expert , whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he would n't be named or quoted , said the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer-maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies . \nMoreover , he said , technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after they 've been `` erased '' from a computer 's memory . \nHe said that Oliver North of Iran-Contra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read . \nNo personal computer , not even the one on a chief executive 's desk , is safe , this speaker noted . \nW. Mark Goode , president of Micronyx Inc. , a Richardson , Texas , firm that makes computer-security products , provided a new definition for Mikhail Gorbachev 's campaign for greater openness , known commonly as glasnost . \nUnder Mr. Gorbachev , Mr. Goode said , the Soviets are openly stealing Western corporate communications . \nHe cited the case of a Swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East . \nAmong the responses the Swiss trader got was one from the Soviet national shipping company , which had n't been invited to submit a bid . \nThe Soviets ' eavesdropping paid off , however , because they got the contract . \nThe University of Toronto stepped deeper into the contest for Connaught BioSciences Inc. by reaching an unusual agreement with Ciba-Geigy Ltd. and Chiron Corp . \nThe University said the two companies agreed to spend 25 million Canadian dollars -LRB- $ 21.3 million -RRB- over 10 years on research at Canadian universities if they are successful in acquiring the vaccine maker . \nIt said $ 10 million would go to the University of Toronto . \nCiba-Geigy and Chiron have made a joint bid of C$ 866 million for Connaught , and Institut Merieux S.A. of France has made a rival bid of C$ 942 million . \nThe University is seeking an injunction against the Merieux bid , arguing that Connaught 's predecessor company agreed in 1972 that Connaught 's ownership would n't be transferred to foreigners . \nThe university implied that it would drop its opposition to foreign ownership if Ciba-Geigy and Chiron are successful with their lower bid . \nIt said the new agreement would `` replace '' the old one that forms the basis of its suit against the Merieux takeover . \n`` Notwithstanding foreign ownership of Connaught , this accord would enhance research and development in Canada , '' said James Keffer , the university 's vice president of research . \nCiba-Geigy is a Swiss pharmaceutical company and Chiron is based in Emeryville , Calif . \nIn a statement , Jacques-Francois Martin , director general of Merieux , said the French company is still determined to acquire Connaught . \nWhile he did n't comment directly on the pact between Ciba-Geigy and the university , he said Merieux can transfer new products and technologies to Connaught more rapidly than other companies `` not currently producing and marketing vaccines -LCB- who -RCB- can only promise this for some ... years in the future . '' \nIn national over-the-counter trading yesterday , Connaught closed at $ 28.625 , up $ 1.25 . \nMicrosoft and other software stocks surged , leading the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter stocks to its biggest advance of the year on breathtaking volume . \nLeading the pack , Microsoft soared 3 3\\/4 , or 4 % , to a record price of 84 1\\/4 on 1.2 million shares . \nOn the other hand , Valley National tumbled 24 % after reporting a sizable third-quarter loss . \nThe Nasdaq composite leaped 7.52 points , or 1.6 % , to 470.80 . \nIts largest previous rise this year came Aug. 7 , when it gained 4.31 . \nThe OTC market 's largest stocks soared as well , as the Nasdaq 100 Index jumped 10.01 , or 2 % , to 463.06 . \nThe Nasdaq Financial Index rose 5.04 , or 1.1 % , to 460.33 . \nBy comparison , the Dow Jones Industrials and the New York Stock Exchange Composite each rose 1.5 % . \nVolume totaled 173.5 million shares , 30 % above this year 's average daily turnover on Nasdaq . \nAmong broader Nasdaq industry groups , the utility index gained 18.11 to 761.38 . \nThe transportation and insurance sectors each posted gains of 8.59 , with the transports finishing at 486.74 and the insurers at 537.91 . \nThe Nasdaq industrial index climbed 8.17 to 458.52 , and the `` other finance '' index , made up of commercial banks and real estate and brokerage firms , rose 3.97 to 545.96 . \nThe index of smaller banks improved 1.97 . \nOf the 4,346 issues that changed hands , 1,435 rose and 629 fell . \nJeremiah Mullins , head of OTC trading at Dean Witter Reynolds , said both institutional and retail investors were buying . \nBut there was a dearth of sellers , traders said , so buyers had to bid prices up to entice them . \n`` There 's no pressure on OTC stocks at this point , '' said Mr. Mullins , who said some buyers are beginning to shop among smaller OTC issues . \nMicrosoft 's surge followed a report this week of substantially improved earnings for its first quarter , ended Sept. 30 . \nThe stock was trading at 69 just two weeks ago . \nRick Sherlund , a Goldman Sachs analyst , has raised his earnings estimates for the company twice in the past two weeks , citing improved margins . \nAfter the earnings were announced , he raised his fiscal 1990 estimate to between $ 3.80 and $ 4 a share . \nMicrosoft earned $ 3.03 a share in fiscal 1989 . \nAmong other software issues , Autodesk jumped 1 1\\/4 to 42 , Lotus Development was unchanged at 32 1\\/2 , Novell jumped 7\\/8 to 30 3\\/4 , Ashton-Tate gained 1\\/4 to 10 5\\/8 , and Oracle Systems rose 3\\/4 to 25 3\\/4 . \nCaere , a new software issue , surged from its offering price of 12 to close at 16 1\\/8 . \nThe company also makes optical character recognition equipment . \nCaere was underwritten by Alex . Brown & Sons . \nAnother recently offered Alex . Brown issue , Rally 's , surged 3 1\\/8 to 23 . \nThe operator of fast-food restaurants , whose shares began trading last Friday , climbed 3 1\\/8 to 23 on 944,000 shares . \nIts 1.7 million-share offering was priced at 15 . \nValley National 's slide of 5 3\\/4 points to 18 1\\/2 on 4.2 million shares followed its report late Wednesday of a $ 72.2 million third-quarter loss . \nIn the 1988 quarter , the Phoenix , Ariz. , commercial banking concern earned $ 18.7 million . \nValley National said its $ 110 million provision for credit losses and $ 11 million provision for other real estate owned is related to weakness in the Arizona real estate market . \nAdditionally , Moody 's Investors Service said it downgraded Valley National 's senior debt and confirmed the company 's commercial paper rating of `` not prime . '' \nA new issue , Exabyte , surged 2 1\\/8 from its initial offering price to close at 12 1\\/8 . \nThe offering was for about 2.8 million shares of the data storage equipment maker ; more than 2.2 million shares changed hands after trading began . \nDell Computer dropped 7\\/8 to 6 . \nThe company said earnings for the year ending Jan. 28 , 1990 , are expected to be 25 to 35 cents a share , compared with a previous estimate of 50 to 60 cents a share . \nNutmeg Industries lost 1 3\\/4 to 14 . \nRaymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg , Fla. , lowered its third-quarter earnings estimate for the company , according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report . \nA.P. Green Industries advanced 1 5\\/8 to 36 1\\/8 . \nEast Rock Partners , which has indicated it might make a bid for the company , said A.P. Green , a refractory products maker , told the partnership it is n't for sale . \nRow 21 of Section 9 of the Upper Reserved at Candlestick Park is a lofty perch , only a few steps from the very top of the stands . \nFrom my orange seat , I looked over the first-base line and the new-mown ball field in the warm sun of the last few minutes before what was to have been the third game of the World Series . \nIt was five in the afternoon , but that was Pacific time . \nBack in New York the work day was already over , so I did n't have to feel guilty . \nEven still , I did feel self-indulgent , and I could n't help remembering my father 's contempt for a rich medical colleague who would go to watch the Tigers on summer afternoons . \nThis ballpark , the Stick , was not a classic baseball stadium -- too symmetrical , too much bald concrete . \nAnd it did n't have the crowded wild intimacy of Yankee Stadium . \nBut I liked the easy friendliness of the people around me , liked it that they 'd brought their children , found it charming that , true citizens of the state of the future , they had brought so many TVs and radios to stay in touch with electroreality at a live event . \nMaybe it was their peculiar sense of history . \nThe broadcasters were , after all , documenting the game , ratifying its occurrence for millions outside the Stick . \nWhy not watch or hear your experience historicized while you were living it ? \nThe day was saturated with the weight of its own impending history . \nLong lines of people waited to buy special souvenir World Series postcards with official postmarks . \nThousands of us had paid $ 5 for the official souvenir book with its historical essays on Series trivia , its historical photographs of great moments in Series past , and its instructions , in English and Spanish , for filling in the scorecard . \nPitcher = lanzador . \nHomerun = jonron . \nPlayers ran out on the field way below , and the stands began to reverberate . \nIt must be a local custom , I thought , stamping feet to welcome the team . \nBut then the noise turned into a roar . \nAnd no one was shouting . \nNo one around me was saying anything . \nBecause we all were busy riding a wave . \nSixty thousand surfers atop a concrete wall , waiting for the wipeout . \nOnly at the moment of maximum roll did I grasp what was going on . \nThen I remembered the quake of '71 , which I experienced in Santa Barbara in a second-story motel room . \nWhen the swaying of the building woke me up , I reasoned that a -RRB- I was in Southern California ; b -RRB- the bed was moving ; c -RRB- it must be a Magic Fingers bed that had short-circuited . \nThen I noticed the overhead light was swaying on its cord and realized what had happened . \nWhat should I do ? \nGet out of the possibly collapsing building to the parking lot . \nBut the lot might split into crevasses , so I had better stand on my car , which probably was wider than the average crevasse . \nFortunately , the quake was over before I managed to run out and stand naked on the hood . \nAt the Stick , while the world shook , I thought of that morning and then it struck me that this time was different . \nIf I survived , I would have achieved every journalist 's highest wish . \nI was an eyewitness of the most newsworthy event on the planet at that moment . \nWhat was my angle ? \nHow would I file ? \nAll these thoughts raced through my head in the 15 seconds of the earthquake 's actual duration . \nThe rest is , of course , history . \nThe Stick did n't fall . \nThe real tragedies occurred elsewhere , as we soon found out . \nBut for a few minutes there , relief abounded . \nA young mother found her boy , who had been out buying a hotdog . \nThe wall behind me was slightly deformed , but the center had held . \nAnd most of us waited for a while for the game to start . \nThen we began to file out , to wait safely on terra firma for the opening pitch . \nIt was during the quiet exodus down the pristine concrete ramps of the Stick that I really understood the point of all those Walkmen and Watchmen . \nThe crowd moved in clumps , clumps magnetized around an electronic nucleus . \nIn this way , while the Stick itself was blacked out , we kept up to date on events . \nWithin 15 minutes of the quake itself , I was able to see pictures of the collapsed section of the Bay Bridge . \nIncreasingly accurate estimates of the severity of the quake became available before I got to my car . \nAnd by then , expensive automobile sound systems were keeping the gridlocked parking lot by the bay informed about the fire causing the big black plume of smoke we saw on the northern horizon . \nDarkness fell . \nBut the broadcasts continued through the blacked-out night , with pictures of the sandwiched highway ganglion in Oakland and firefighting in the Marina district . \nBy then , our little sand village of cars had been linked with a global village of listeners and viewers . \nEveryone at the Stick that day had started out as a spectator and ended up as a participant . \nIn fact , the entire population of the Bay Area had ended up with this dual role of actor and audience . \nThe reporters were victims and some of the victims turned into unofficial reporters . \nThe outstanding example of this was the motorist on the Bay Bridge who had the presence of mind to take out a video camera at the absolutely crucial moment and record the car in front as it fell into the gap in the roadway . \nThe tape was on tv before the night was out . \nMarshall McLuhan , you should have been there at that hour . \nInvestors who received Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's latest stock commentary may be left with blank expressions . \nThe first 10 pages of the 76-page Weekly Portfolio Perspective are completely blank , except for the page numbers . \nRather than printing devils , Shearson puts all the blame on the unpredictable stock market . \nThe plunge made Shearson 's market commentary instantly out of date . \nIn fact , last Friday 's 190.58-point tumble in the stock market caught many people and businesses by surprise , not the least of them brokerage firms such as Shearson that print their weekly market commentaries on Fridays for dissemination the following week . \nShearson , a 62%-owned unit of American Express Co. , did n't have enough time to update its market commentary so , `` We decided to kill our strategy pieces , '' says Jack Rivkin , the head of Shearson 's research department . \nThe first thought some investors had was that a red-faced Shearson must have been wildly bullish on stocks in its original commentary , and that 's why it purged its pages . \nInvestors recalled that Shearson last week had been advising that `` the market is still exhibiting all the signs of a further advance . '' \nMany other brokerage firms had similarly bullish views . \nBut Mr. Rivkin insists that the 10 pages were n't pulled because they were too bullish . \nInstead , he says , `` they were cautious , and that was n't the message we wanted to deliver '' on Monday . \nAs Mr. Rivkin explains it , `` We were raising some caution flags about rate rises in Europe and concerns about the LBO market . \nAnd by late Friday afternoon , actually after the close , we decided that was the wrong tone to take . \nWith the market down , we wanted to tell people to put their orders in on the opening . '' \nBoth before and after the Friday plunge , Shearson has maintained a recommended portfolio weighting of 65 % stocks , 20 % bonds and 15 % cash . \nSheldon B. Lubar , chairman of Lubar & Co. , and John L. Murray , chairman of Universal Foods Corp. , were elected to the board of this engine maker . \nThey succeed Robert W. Kasten and John R. Parker , who reached the mandatory retirement age . \nChina 's slide toward recession is beginning to look like a free fall . \nIn a report on China 's foundering economy , the official State Statistical Bureau disclosed that industrial output last month rose 0.9 % from a year earlier - the lowest growth rate in a decade for September . \nRetail sales are plummeting , while consumer prices still are rising . \nChinese and foreign economists now predict prolonged stagflation : low growth and high inflation . \n`` The economy is crashing hard , '' says an Asian economist in Beijing . \n`` The slowdown is taking hold a lot more quickly and devastatingly than anyone had expected . '' \nA lengthy recession , if it materializes , would drain state coffers and create severe hardships for urban workers . \nExperts predict the coming year will be characterized by flat or negative industrial growth , rising unemployment and a widening budget deficit . \nUnless the government suddenly reverses course , wages for most workers wo n't keep pace with inflation , creating a potential source of urban unrest . \nThe economy 's slowdown is due only partly to the austerity program launched in September 1988 to cool an overheated economy and tame inflation . \n-LRB- Industrial output surged 21 % in 1988 , while inflation peaked last February at nearly 30 % . -RRB- \nThe slowdown also results from chronic energy and raw-materials shortages that force many factories to restrict operations to two or three days a week . \nIn Western , market-driven countries , recessions often have a bright side : prodding the economy to greater efficiency . \nIn China , however , there is n't likely to be any silver lining because the economy remains guided primarily by the state . \nInstead , China is likely to shell out ever-greater subsidies to its coddled state-run enterprises , which ate up $ 18 billion in bailouts last year . \nNor are any of these inefficient monoliths likely to be allowed to go bankrupt . \nRather , the brunt of the slowdown will be felt in the fast-growing private and semi-private `` township '' enterprises , which have fallen into disfavor as China 's leaders re-emphasize an orthodox Marxist preference for public ownership . \n`` When the going gets rough , China penalizes the efficient and rewards the incompetent , '' says a Western economist . \nReports of an economy near recession come as officials prepare a major Communist Party plenum for sometime in the next few weeks . \nThe meeting is expected to call for heightened austerity for two years . \nBut with industrial growth stagnant and inflation showing signs of easing , some voices may call for measures to pump new life into the economy . \nSome analysts believe China soon will begin relaxing economic controls , particularly by loosening credit . \nThat would benefit Chinese enterprises as well as Sino-foreign joint ventures , both of which have been plagued by shortages of working capital . \nA dangerous buildup this year of billions of dollars in inter-company debts threatens , if unchecked , to bring the economy to a collapse . \nOne sign of a possible easing of credit policy was the decision this week of People 's Bank of China , the central bank , to allocate $ 5.4 billion in short-term loans to pay farmers for the autumn harvest , the official China Daily reported . \nBut while pumping more money into the economy would bring relief to many industries , it also runs the risk of triggering another period of runaway growth and steep inflation . \nThe cycle has been repeated several times since China began reforming its planned economy in 1979 . \nAnd , because China 's leaders have abandoned plans to drastically reform the economy , it is likely to continue , analysts say . \nThe statistical bureau 's report , cited in China Daily , notes that industrial output in September totaled $ 29.4 billion , a rise of just 0.9 % from a year earlier . \nOutput declined in several provinces , including Jiangsu and Zhejiang , two key coastal areas , and Sichuan , the nation 's agricultural breadbasket . \nProduction in Shanghai , China 's industrial powerhouse and the largest source of tax revenue for the central government , fell 1.8 % for the month . \nNationwide , output of light industrial products declined 1.8 % -- `` the first decline in 10 years , '' a bureau spokesman told China Daily . \nIn an unusually direct statement , the bureau spokesman recommended that state banks extend more credit to shopkeepers so that they can purchase manufacturers ' goods . \n`` This will prevent a slide in industrial production , which will otherwise cause new panic buyings , '' the spokesman said . \nThe 1986 tax overhaul , the biggest achievement of President Reagan 's second term , is beginning to fall apart , and interest groups are lining up for tax goodies all over Capitol Hill . \nReal-estate executives are lobbying to ease anti-tax-shelter rules . \nCharitable groups are trying to reinstate the write-off for contributions made by individuals who do n't itemize their deductions . \nBig auction houses want to make collectibles eligible for lower capital-gains taxes . \nAnd heavy-industry lobbyists are quietly discussing the possibility of reinstating the investment tax credit . \n`` Everything is up for grabs , '' says Theodore Groom , a lobbyist for mutual life-insurance companies . \nAdds Robert Juliano , the head lobbyist for a variety of interests that want to protect the tax deduction for travel and entertainment expenses : `` It appears as though the whole thing is wide open again . '' \nThe catalyst has been the congressional move to restore preferential tax treatment for capital gains , an effort that is likely to succeed in this Congress . \nOther fundamental `` reforms '' of the 1986 act have been threatened as well . \nThe House seriously considered raising the top tax rate paid by individuals with the highest incomes . \nThe Senate Finance Committee voted to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts , and also to bring back income averaging for farmers , a tax preference that allows income to be spread out over several years . \nAs part of the same bill , the finance panel also voted in favor of billions of dollars in narrow tax breaks for individuals and corporations , in what committee member Sen. David Pryor -LRB- D. , Ark . -RRB- calls a `` feeding frenzy '' of special-interest legislating . \nThe beneficiaries would range from pineapple growers to rich grandparents to tuxedo-rental shops . \nTo be sure , the full Senate , facing a fast-approaching budget deadline , last Friday stripped away all of the tax breaks that were contained in the Finance Committee bill . \nBut lawmakers of both parties agree that the streamlining was temporary . \nOther bills will be moving soon that are expected to carry many of the tax cuts , including both the capital-gains and IRA provisions . \n`` There is n't any doubt that the thread of the '86 code has been given a mighty tug , '' says Rep. Thomas Downey -LRB- D. , N.Y . -RRB- . \n`` You 'll see the annual unraveling of it . '' \n`` It 's back to tax-give-away time for the select few , '' says Rep. William Gray of Pennsylvania , the third-ranking Democrat in the House . \nReferring to the chairmen of the Senate and House tax-writing committees , he adds , `` Next year , every special-interest group is going to be there knocking on Lloyd Bentsen 's door , on Danny Rostenkowski 's door . '' \nMany groups are n't waiting that long . \nJust last week , a House Ways and Means subcommittee held a lengthy meeting to hear the pleas of individual cities , companies and interest groups who want to open their own special loopholes . \n`` It 's a Swiss-cheese factory and the cheese smells pretty good , '' commented one veteran lobbyist who was watching the proceedings . \nEven lobbyists for heavy industry , one of the interests hit hardest in the 1986 bill , are encouraged . \nThe return of pro-investment tax breaks such as those for capital gains and IRAs `` creates more of a mood or a mindset that is helpful for getting better depreciation -LRB- write-offs -RRB- or investment credits , '' says Paul Huard , a vice president for the National Association of Manufacturers . \nCorporate lobbyist Charls Walker is planning a spring conference to discuss what tax changes to make to improve `` competitiveness . '' \nIn reaction to proposed capital-gains legislation , groups are lobbying to make sure they are n't left off the gravy train . \nReal-estate interests , for example , are protesting an omission in President Bush 's capital-gains proposal : It does n't include real-estate gains . \n`` If there is going to be a tax scheme that contemplates lower treatment of capital gains , they certainly want to be part of it , '' says real-estate lobbyist Wayne Thevenot of Concord Associates . \nIn the House-passed tax bill , Mr. Thevenot got his wish ; real-estate assets are included in the capital-gains provision . \nBut Sotheby 's , Christie 's and the National Association of Antique Dealers are still trying to get theirs . \nThey have sent a letter to congressional tax-writers asking that gains from the sale of collectibles also be given preferential treatment . \n`` Collectibles should continue to be recognized as capital assets , '' the letter states . \nAll of this talk is antithetical to the Tax Reform Act of 1986 . \nIn exchange for dramatically lower tax rates , the framers of that legislation sought to eliminate most of the exemptions , deductions and credits that gave some taxpayers an advantage over others . \nThe goal was to tax people with roughly equivalent incomes equally , and to eliminate the many shelters that allowed the wealthy to escape taxes . \nTwo of the major ways that tax-writers managed to attain these ends were to scrap the preferential treatment of capital gains and to curtail the use of paper losses , also known as passive losses , that made many tax shelters possible . \nMany other tax benefits also were swept away . \nThis year Congress , with prodding from President Bush , has been busy trying to put many of these same tax preferences back into the code . \nIt appears likely that , this year or next , some form of capital-gains preference and passive-loss restoration will be enacted . \nOther tax benefits probably will be restored and created . \nThe main obstacle is finding a way to pay for them . \n`` The '86 act was a fluke . \nThey wanted reform and they got a revolution , '' says overhaul advocate Rep. Willis Gradison -LRB- R. , Ohio -RRB- . \nSo , is the tax code now open game again ? \nMr. Juliano thinks so . \nOne recent Saturday morning he stayed inside the Capitol monitoring tax-and-budget talks instead of flying to San Francisco for a fund-raiser and then to his hometown of Chicago for the 30th reunion of St. Ignatius High School . \n`` I 'm too old to waste a weekend , but that 's what I did , '' the 48-year-old Mr. Juliano moans . \n`` These days , anything can happen . \nLufthansa AG said passenger volume climbed 5.2 % for the first nine months of 1989 to 15.3 million passengers from 14.5 million passengers in the year-earlier period . \nThe West German national air carrier said cargo volume jumped 12 % to 638,000 metric tons from 569,000 tons a year ago . \nLoad factor , or percentage of seats filled , climbed to 67.1 % from 66.6 % , even though the number of flights rose 6.9 % to 215,845 in the first-three quarters . \nFrom January through September , the distance flown by Lufthansa airplanes rose 5.6 % to 266.2 million kilometers from a year earlier , the company added . \nRaymond Chandler , in a 1950 letter defending a weak Hemingway book , likened a champion writer to a baseball pitcher . \nWhen the champ has lost his stuff , the great mystery novelist wrote , `` when he can no longer throw the high hard one , he throws his heart instead . \nHe throws something . \nHe does n't just walk off the mound and weep . '' \nChandler might have been predicting the course of his own career . \nHis last published novel featuring private detective Philip Marlowe , the inferior `` Playback '' -LRB- 1958 -RRB- , at times read almost like a parody of his previous work . \nWhen he died in 1959 , Chandler left behind four chapters of yet another Marlowe book , `` The Poodle Springs Story , '' which seemed to go beyond parody into something like burlesque . \n`` Champ '' Chandler 's last pitch , apparently , was a screwball . \nNow Robert Parker , author of several best sellers featuring Spenser , a contemporary private eye in the Marlowe mold , has with the blessings of the Chandler estate been hired to complete `` The Poodle Springs Story . '' \nThe result , `` Poodle Springs '' -LRB- Putnam 's , 288 pages , $ 18.95 -RRB- is an entertaining , easy to read and fairly graceful extension of the Marlowe chronicle , full of hard-boiled wisecracks and California color . \nIf it does not quite have Chandler 's special magic -- well , at the end , neither did Chandler . \nAs the book begins , a newly wed Marlowe roars into the desert resort of Poodle -LRB- a.k.a . Palm -RRB- Springs at the wheel of a Cadillac Fleetwood . \nHis bride is the rich and beautiful Linda Loring , a character who also appeared in Chandler 's `` The Long Goodbye '' and `` Playback . '' \nPhilip and Linda move into her mansion and ca n't keep their hands off each other , even in front of the Hawaiian\\/Japanese houseman . \nBut the lovebirds have a conflict . \nHe wants to continue being a low-paid private eye , and she wants him to live off the million dollars she 's settled on him . \nThat 's Chandler 's setup . \nMr. Parker spins it into a pretty satisfying tale involving Poodle Springs high life , Hollywood low life and various folk who hang their hats in both worlds . \nThe supporting lineup is solid , the patter is amusing and there 's even a cameo by Bernie Ohls , the `` good cop '' of previous Chandler books who still does n't hesitate to have Marlowe jailed when it suits his purposes . \nThe style throughout bears a strong resemblance to Chandler 's prose at its most pared down . \nAll told , Mr. Parker does a better job of making a novel out of this abandoned fragment than anyone might have had a right to expect . \nBut there are grounds for complaint . \nAt one point , the reader is two steps ahead of Marlowe in catching on to a double identity scam -- and Marlowe is supposed to be the pro . \nMore bothersome , there are several apparent anachronisms . \nContact lenses , tank tops , prostitutes openly working the streets of Hollywood and the Tequila Sunrise cocktail all seem out of place in the 1950s . \nA little more care in re-creating Marlowe 's universe would have made the book that much more enjoyable . \nMr. Nolan is a contributing editor at Los Angeles Magazine . \nKo Shioya spent eight years as the editor in chief of the Japanese edition of Reader 's Digest . \n`` Japan has been a major importer of foreign information and news , '' says Mr. Shioya . \n`` But one gets fed up with importing information and news . '' \nMr. Shioya has turned the tables . \nToday , he is publisher of Business Tokyo magazine , the first English-language business magazine devoted to coverage of Japanese business . \nAfter a slick redesign , the two-year-old magazine has been relaunched this month by its parent company , Keizaikai Corp. , the Tokyo-based company with interests that include financial services , book publishing and a tourist agency . \nPrinted in the U.S. and carrying the line `` The Insider 's Japan , '' Business Tokyo 's October cover story was `` The World 's No. 1 Customer '' -- Japanese women . \nKeizaikai is one of a small but growing band of Japanese companies taking their first steps into American publishing , after making major investments in entertainment , real estate and banking companies here . \nJapanese concerns have retained a number of publishing consultants and media brokers to study the U.S. market , including the New York-based investment banker Veronis , Suhler & Associates . \nAnd they are quietly linking up with U.S. publishing trade groups . \n`` Japanese publishers want to be introduced to the publishing and information industries , '' said John Veronis , chairman of Veronis Suhler . \nWhile there are n't any major deals in the works currently on the scale of Sony Corp. 's recent $ 3.4 billion agreement to buy Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , observers do n't rule out a transaction of that size . \n`` The Japanese take the long view . '' said Mr. Veronis . \n`` It may not be weeks or months , but they are also opportunistic and if they feel comfortable , they will move on a deal , '' he said . \nIn recent months , three big Tokyo-based publishing concerns -- including Nikkei Business Publications , Nikkei Home -LRB- no relation -RRB- , and Magazine House -- applied for membership in Magazine Publishers of America , which represents almost all U.S. consumer magazines . \nJapanese involvement in American publishing has been so small to date that magazines such as Business Tokyo are considered groundbreakers . \nWhen Keizaikai launched Business Tokyo in 1987 , it appealed to a more multinational audience . \nThe magazine was overhauled with the aid of American magazine design gurus Milton Glaser and Walter Bernard , and targets top-level U.S. executives with Japanese and American advertisers . \nAmerican publishers appear more than ready to do some selling . \nSusumu Ohara , president of Nihon Keizai Shinbun America Inc. , publisher of the Japan Economic Journal , said he receives telephone calls weekly from media bankers on whether his parent company is interested in buying a U.S. consumer or business magazine . \n`` The Japanese are in the early stage right now , '' said Thomas Kenney , a onetime media adviser for First Boston Corp. who was recently appointed president of Reader 's Digest Association 's new Magazine Publishing Group . \n`` Before , they were interested in hard assets and they saw magazines as soft . \nNow they realize magazines are as much a franchise as Nabisco is a franchise . \nBell Atlantic Corp. and Southern New England Telecommunications posted strong profit gains for the third quarter , while Nynex Corp. , Pacific Telesis Group and U S West Inc. reported earnings declines for the period . \nRate settlements in Minnesota and Colorado depressed U S West 's third-quarter profit . \nDenver-based U S West said net income dropped 8.9 % , noting that the year-ago quarter included the sale of a building by its BetaWest Properties unit . \nRevenue dropped 4.3 % to $ 2.3 billion from $ 2.4 billion , reflecting declines in its consumer-telephone sector , long-distance carrier business and diversified division . \nRevenue from business-telephone operations grew 3.3 % to $ 618.9 million from $ 599.4 million a year ago . \nNew telephone lines posted healthy growth . \nOverall they increased 2.8 % to 12.1 million , putting U S West over the 12 million mark for the first time . \nBusiness lines increased 3.7 % to 3.3 million . \n`` On a truly comparable basis , we 've seen modest earnings growth this year from the operations of our company , '' said Jack MacAllister , chairman and chief executive officer . \n`` The major negative factor was the cumulative impact of regulatory activity over the past two years . '' \nHe said the company expects to be `` on target '' with analysts ' projections by year end but conceded that the fourth quarter represents `` a significant challenge . '' \nExpenses in the quarter dropped 11.2 % to $ 664.3 million from $ 747.7 million a year ago . \nYesterday , U S West shares rose 75 cents to close at $ 71.25 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . \nPhiladelphia-based Bell Atlantic said net rose 6.5 % , aided by strong growth in the network-services business and an increase in the number of new telephone lines . \nRevenue jumped 5.6 % to $ 2.9 billion from $ 2.8 billion in the year-ago quarter . \nRevenue from financial and real-estate services jumped 23 % to $ 177.4 million from $ 144.1 million a year ago . \nNetwork-access revenue from long-distance telephone companies increased 6.4 % to $ 618.6 million . \nBell Atlantic added 148,000 new telephone lines in the quarter for a total of 16.9 million . \nThe company said per-share earnings were slightly reduced by the sale of 4.1 million shares of treasury stock to the company 's newly formed Employee Stock Ownership Plans . \nIn composite trading on the Big Board , Bell Atlantic closed at $ 100.625 , up $ 1.50 a share . \nAt Nynex , net slumped 14.8 % , primarily because of a continuing strike by 60,000 employees , lower-than-expected profit at its New York Telephone unit and significantly higher taxes and costs . \nState and local taxes increased to $ 131.3 million from $ 99.1 million a year ago . \nNynex said expenses rose 4.5 % to $ 2.73 billion from $ 2.61 billion , a $ 119 million increase . \nMost of the higher costs were associated with acquisitions and growth in nonregulated business units , it added . \n`` Our net income is n't where we would want it to be at this point , '' said William C. Ferguson , chairman and chief executive officer . \n`` This deviation from our past growth patterns is caused largely by lower earnings at New York Telephone . '' \nMr. Ferguson said a continued softness in New York City area 's economy and increased competition , particularly in the private-line market , took a heavy toll on earnings . \nThe three-month-old strike at Nynex seriously hurt the installation of new telephone lines in the quarter . \nNynex said access lines in service at the end of the quarter were off 18,000 from the previous quarter , which reported an increase of 160,000 new access lines . \nRevenue rose to $ 3.31 billion from $ 3.18 billion , mostly from acquisition of AGS Computers and robust non-regulated businesses . \nIn Big Board composite trading yesterday , Nynex common closed at $ 81.125 , up $ 1.625 . \nSouthern New England Telecommunications , which bolstered its marketing efforts for telephone and non-telephone subsidiaries , reported that net increased 8.1 % . \nWalter H. Monteith Jr. , SNET chairman and chief executive officer , said : `` Innovative marketing of our products and services contributed to increase revenue . '' \nRevenue and sales increased 7.5 % to $ 423.9 million from $ 394.4 million a year earlier . \nYellow pages advertising sales rose 11.8 % to $ 41.2 million . \nCost and expenses for the quarter , excluding interest , increased 6.1 % to $ 333.3 million from $ 314 million the year before . \nSNET common rose $ 1.25 to $ 85.50 a share yesterday in composite trading on the Big Board . \nSan Francisco-based Pacific Telesis said net declined 12.6 % , primarily because of regulatory action . \nRevenue was about flat at $ 2.4 billion . \nRevenue was reduced $ 33 million by three extraordinary items : a California Public Utilities Commission refund for an American Telephone & Telegraph Co. billing adjustment ; a provision for productivity sharing to be paid to customers in 1990 and a one-time accrual for a toll settlement with long-distance telephone companies . \nExcluding the one-time charges , the company would have posted earnings of $ 298 million , or 73 cents a share . \nThe company also was hurt by a $ 289 million rate reduction that went into effect in 1989 . \n`` This is a good quarter for us in terms of our business fundamentals , '' said Sam Ginn , chairman and chief executive officer . \nPacific Telesis said new telephone lines increased 4.5 % for a total of about $ 13.5 million for the quarter ; toll calls increased 9.6 % to 807 million and minutes of telephone usage increased to 9.9 billion . \nIn Big Board composite trading yesterday , Pacific Telesis common closed at $ 45.50 , up 87.5 cents . \na - Includes a one-time gain of $ 88.7 million from a commonstock sale by U S West 's U S West New Vector Group . \nb - Includes a $ 41.3 million gain on the sale of FiberCom . \nAmoco Corp. said third-quarter net income plunged 39 % to $ 336 million , or 65 cents a share , as gasoline refining and marketing profits lagged substantially behind last year 's record level . \nA charge of $ 80 million related to projected environmental costs in its refining and marketing operations further depressed results . \nA spokesman said Amoco completed an environmental analysis last quarter but that no single clean-up project was responsible . \nIn the 1988 third quarter , the Chicago-based oil company earned $ 552 million , or $ 1.07 a share . \nRevenue in the latest quarter rose 12 % to $ 6.6 billion from $ 5.91 billion . \nAside from the special charge , Amoco 's results were in line with Wall Street estimates . \nThe company 's stock ended at $ 48.375 , up 25 cents in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . \nAmoco is the first major oil company to report third-quarter results . \nAnalysts expect others to show a similar pattern . \nGenerally in the quarter , overproduction of gasoline and higher crude oil prices pressured profitability . \nThe industry 's chemical profits also declined because excess capacity has depressed prices . \nGasoline margins may rebound this quarter , some industry officials say , but they believe chemical margins could worsen . \nAmerican Petrofina Inc. , a Dallas-based integrated oil company , yesterday said its third-quarter earnings declined by more than half . \nFina blamed lower chemical prices , reduced gasoline margins and refinery maintenance shutdowns . \nIt said net income dropped to $ 15.1 million , or 98 cents a share , from $ 35.2 million , or $ 2.66 a share . \nSales rose 2.2 % to $ 711.9 million from $ 696.1 million . \nAmoco 's refining and marketing profit in the quarter fell to $ 134 million from $ 319 million . \nChemical earnings declined by one-third to $ 120 million last year 's robust levels . \nAmoco 's domestic oil and natural gas operations recorded a profit of $ 104 million in the quarter compared with a loss of $ 5 million , `` primarily on the strength of higher crude oil prices , '' said Chairman Richard M. Morrow . \nAmoco also sharply boosted natural-gas output , part of it from properties acquired from Tenneco Inc. last year . \nBut foreign exploration and production earnings fell sharply , to $ 12 million from $ 95 million . \nHigher oil prices were n't enough to offset a roughly $ 20 million charge related to a 10 % reduction in Amoco 's Canadian work force as well as increased exploration expenses . \nFor the nine months , Amoco said that net income fell to $ 1.29 billion from $ 1.69 billion but if unusual items are excluded , operations produced essentially flat results . \nRevenue rose 12 % to $ 19.93 billion from $ 17.73 billion . \nJames F. Gero , former chairman and chief executive officer of Varo Inc. , and Richard J. Hatchett III , a Dallas investment banker , were elected directors of this medical-products concern , boosting the board to seven members . \nFor retailers , Christmas , not Halloween , promises to be this year 's spookiest season . \nMany retailers fear a price war will erupt if cash-strapped companies such as Campeau Corp. slash tags to spur sales . \nConcerns about the stock market , doubts about the economy in general and rising competition from catalog companies also haunt store operators . \n`` Profits at Christmas could be under attack for every retailer , '' asserts Norman Abramson , president and chief operating officer of Clothestime Inc. , an off-price chain . \nEven if there is n't any widespread discounting , the outlook for industry profits is n't good . \nManagement Horizons forecasts a 1.4 % profit decline for non-auto retailers this year , after annual drops that averaged 4.5 % in 1988 and 1987 . \n`` For the last two and a half years , retailing has been in a mild recession , '' says Carl Steidtmann , chief economist at the Columbus , Ohio , consulting firm . \nThis year , many stores are entering the Christmas season in turmoil : Bonwit Teller and B. Altman parent L.J. Hooker Corp. is operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code ; B.A.T Industries PLC 's healthy Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's chains are on the auction block ; Campeau 's Bloomingdale 's is also on the block . \nIndustry observers expect a wide divergence in performance . \nStores in a state of confusion are likely to fare poorly , and to lose customers to stable chains such as Limited Inc. , May Department Stores Co. and Dillard Department Stores Inc. , which should do well . \n`` There are going to be very clear winners and very clear losers , '' says Cynthia Turk , a Touche Ross & Co. retail consultant . \nSays Mr. Steidtmann : `` I 'm looking for a bi-polar Christmas . '' \nEconomists expect general merchandise sales in the fourth quarter to rise 4.5 % to 6 % from year-ago figures . \nBut Mr. Steidtmann predicts that healthy stores hawking mostly apparel could ring up gains of as much as 25 % to 30 % . \nTroubled chains could see their sales drop as much as 8 % , he believes , as managers distracted by fears about the future allow their stores to get sloppy . \nThin merchandise selections at the most troubled chains are also expected to hurt sales . \nCatalog companies are likely to p",

            "message": ". \nBut the Nikkei fell an overall 1.8 % in value that day compared with Wall Street 's far sharper 6.9 % drop on Oct. 13 . \nThe Tokyo market 's resiliency helped participants to regain confidence gradually as they spent more time on analyzing factors that caused the Friday plunge and realized these problems were unique to New York stocks and not directly related to Tokyo . \nThe Nikkei continued to gain for the rest of the week , adding 1017.69 points in four days -- more than erasing Monday 's losses . \nBut further major advances on the Nikkei are n't foreseen this week by market observers . \nInvestors are still waiting to see how the U.S. government will decide on interest rates and how the dollar will be stabilized . \nSome high-priced issues made a comeback Friday . \nPioneer surged 450 yen -LRB- $ 3.16 -RRB- to 6,050 yen -LRB- $ 42.60 -RRB- . \nKyocera advanced 80 yen to 5,440 . \nFanuc gained 100 to 7,580 . \nBreweries attracted investors because of their land property holdings that could figure in development or other plans , traders said . \nSapporo gained 80 to 1,920 and Kirin added 60 to 2,070 . \nHousings , constructions and pharmaceuticals continued to be bought following Thursday 's gains because of strong earnings outlooks . \nDaiwa House gained 50 to 2,660 . \nMisawa Homes was up 20 at 2,960 . \nKajima advanced 40 to 2,120 and Ohbayashi added 50 to 1,730 . \nFujisawa added 80 to 2,010 and Mochida advanced 230 to 4,400 . \nLondon share prices were influenced largely by declines on Wall Street and weakness in the British pound . \nThe key Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 10.2 points lower at 2179.1 , above its intraday low of 2176.9 , but off the day 's high of 2189 . \nThe index finished 2.4 % under its close of 2233.9 the previous Friday , although it recouped some of the sharp losses staged early last week on the back of Wall Street 's fall . \nLondon was weak throughout Friday 's trading , however , on what dealers attributed to generally thin interest ahead of the weekend and this week 's potentially important U.K. trade figures for September . \nThe FT-SE 100 largely remained within an 11-point range establshed within the first hour of trading before it eased to an intraday low late in the session when a flurry of program selling pushed Wall Street lower . \nThe FT 30-share index closed 11.0 points lower at 1761.0 . \nVolume was extremely thin at 351.3 million shares , the lightest volume of the week and modestly under Thursday 's 387.4 million shares . \nDealers said the day 's action was featureless outside some response to sterling 's early weakness against the mark , and fears that Wall Street might open lower after its strong leap forward Thursday . \nThey added that market-makers were largely sidelined after aggressively supporting the market Thursday in their quest to cover internal shortages of FT-SE 100 shares . \nInterest may remain limited into tomorrow 's U.K. trade figures , which the market will be watching closely to see if there is any improvement after disappointing numbers in the previous two months . \nThe key corporate news of the day was that British Airways decided to withdraw from a management-led bid for UAL Corp. , the parent of United Airlines . \nBritish Airways rose initially after announcing its withdrawal from the UAL deal . \nDealers said they viewed the initial # 390-million -LRB- $ 622 million -RRB- outlay for a 15 % stake in the airline as a bit much . \nIts shares slid in late dealings to close a penny per share lower at 197 pence . \nThe airline was the most active FT-SE 100 at 8.2 million shares traded . \nThe next most active top-tier stock was B.A.T Industries , the target of Sir James Goldsmith 's # 13.4 billion bid . \nThe company gained shareholder approval Thursday to restructure in a bid to fend off the hostile takeover . \nSir James said Thursday night that his plans for the takeover had n't changed . \nB.A.T ended the day at 778 , down 5 , on turnover of 7.5 million shares . \nDealers said it was hit by some profit-taking after gains since mid-week . \nIn other active shares , Trusthouse Forte shed 10 to 294 on volume of 6.4 million shares after a Barclays De Zoete Wedd downgrading , while Hillsdown Holdings , a food products concern , was boosted 2 to 271 after it disclosed it would seek shareholder approval to begin share repurchases . \nElsewhere in Europe , share prices closed higher in Stockholm , Brussels and Milan . \nPrices were lower in Frankfurt , Zurich , Paris and Amsterdam . \nSouth African gold stocks closed moderately lower . \nShare prices closed higher in Sydney , Taipei , Wellington , Manila , Hong Kong and Singapore and were lower in Seoul . \nHere are price trends on the world 's major stock markets , as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective , Geneva . \nTo make them directly comparable , each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100 . \nThe percentage change is since year-end . \nThe U.S. is required to notify foreign dictators if it knows of coup plans likely to endanger their lives , government officials said . \nThe notification policy was part of a set of guidelines on handling coups outlined in a secret 1988 exchange of letters between the Reagan administration and the Senate Intelligence Committee . \nThe existence of the guidelines has become known since President Bush disclosed them privately to seven Republican senators at a White House meeting last Monday . \nOfficials familiar with the meeting said Mr. Bush cited the policy as an example of the sort of congressional requirements the administration contends contribute to the failure of such covert actions as this month 's futile effort to oust Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega . \nAccording to the officials , Mr. Bush even read to the senators selections from a highly classified letter from the committee to the White House discussing the guidelines . \nThey said the president conceded the notification requirement did n't affect his decision to lend only minor support to this month 's Panama coup effort . \nNo notification was ever considered , officials said , apparently because the U.S. did n't think the coup plotters intended to kill Mr. Noriega , but merely sought to imprison him . \nWhat 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that the notification requirement is likely to be dropped from the guidelines on coup attempts that are being rewritten by the panel and the White House . \nThe rewriting was launched at a meeting between Mr. Bush and intelligence committee leaders Oct. 12 , a few days before the meeting at which the president complained about the rules . \nHowever , the disclosure of the guidelines , first reported last night by NBC News , is already being interpreted on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort to pressure Congress . \nIt has reopened the bitter wrangling between the White House and Congress over who is responsible for the failure to oust Mr. Noriega and , more broadly , for difficulties in carrying out covert activities abroad . \nA statement issued by the office of the committee chairman , Sen. David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla. -RRB- , charged that the disclosure is part of a continuing effort to shift the criticism for the failure of the recent coup attempt in Panama . \nThe statement added , `` Someone has regrettably chosen to selectively summarize portions of highly classified correspondence between the two branches of government . \nNot only does this come close to a violation of law , it violates the trust we have all worked to develop . '' \nSen. Boren said , `` It 's time to stop bickering and work together to develop a clear and appropriate policy to help the country in the future . \nI 've invited the president to send his suggestions to the committee . '' \nRepublican Sen. William Cohen of Maine , the panel 's vice chairman , said of the disclosure that `` a text torn out of context is a pretext , and it is unfair for those in the White House who are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . '' \nSen. Boren said the committee could n't defend itself by making the documents public because that would violate classification rules . \nBut the chairman and other committee members stressed that the notification guideline was n't imposed on the White House by a meddling Congress . \nInstead , both congressional and administration officials agreed , it grew out of talks about coup-planning in Panama that were initiated by the administration in July 1988 and stretched into last October . \nThe guideline was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how the U.S. might operate during foreign coups in light of the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations . \nIn fact , yesterday the administration and Congress were still differing on what had been agreed to . \nOne administration official said notification was required even if the U.S. `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that seem likely to endanger a dictator 's life . \nBut a congressional source close to the panel said the rule only covered coup plans directly involving the U.S. . \nAlthough the notification guideline was n't carried out in this month 's coup attempt , some administration officials argue that it may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in Panama . \nOne senior administration official called the guideline `` outrageous '' and said it could make U.S. operatives reluctant to even listen to coup plans for fear they may get into legal trouble . \nThe issue came to a head last year , officials recalled , partly because the Reagan administration had sought unsuccessfully to win committee approval of funding for new Panama coup efforts . \nIn addition , both administration and congressional officials said the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred by a White House desire to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign . \nThough the assassination ban is a White House order that Congress never voted on , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over its interpretation . \nLast week , Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster publicly called on Congress to provide new interpretations of the assassination order that would permit the U.S. more freedom to act in coups . \nThe administration has reacted to criticism that it mishandled the latest coup attempt by seeking to blame Congress for restrictions the White House said have hampered its freedom of action . \nHowever , last week Mr. Webster 's two top CIA deputies said congressional curbs had n't hampered the spy agency 's role in the coup attempt in Panama . \nNevertheless , the administration 's criticisms appeared to have made some headway with Sens. Boren and Cohen after their Oct. 12 meeting with the president . \nThe three men agreed to rewrite the guidelines , without changing the basic assassination ban , to clear up any ambiguities that may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders . \nThe new argument over the notification guideline , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that existed . \nGerald F. Seib contributed to this article . \n-LRB- During its centennial year , The Wall Street Journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of American business history . -RRB- \nMUTUAL FUNDS ARRIVED IN THE U.S. during the Roaring Twenties -LRB- they had been in Britain for a century -RRB- , but they did n't boom until the money market fund was created in the 1970s . \nBy 1980 , there were more than 100 such funds . \nBesides creating a vehicle for investors , money market funds also helped rewrite banking regulations . \nThe idea was to let small investors , the backbone of the fund business , deal in the money market 's high short-term interest rates . \nThis had been the exclusive province of those rich enough to use six-figure sums to get income that was figured beyond the third or fourth decimal place . \nThe now-standard price of $ 1 a share came about by accident . \nAn early fund had filed a registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission that included a fixed $ 1 price . \nIt arrived just as the regulator handling such operations was retiring . \nHis successor approved the $ 1 price in the process of clearing the backed-up papers on his desk . \nWhen Dreyfus started the first advertising-backed retail fund in February 1974 , it was priced at $ 10 a share -LRB- and reached $ 1 billion in assets in one year . -RRB- \nDreyfus moved to the $ 1 price after the SEC set standards -- an average 120-day maturity of high-grade paper -- that are still the rule . \nKeeping the listed price at a dollar is primarily a convenience . \nActually , the funds do fluctuate , but beyond the third decimal place . \nRounding-off keeps them at $ 1 . \nEventually , the money funds ' success forced relaxation of curbs on bank interest rates to allow banks to offer competing yields . \nThe new instrument also introduced many to the industry -- 30 % of fund owners -LRB- there are more than 54 million accounts -RRB- started with a money fund . \nToday more than 470 money market funds have total assets exceeding $ 350 billion . \n-LRB- The companion tax-exempt funds add $ 71 billion . -RRB- \nDreyfus alone has seen its money market funds grow from $ 1 billion in 1975 to closes to $ 15 billion today . \nProcter & Gamble Co. and Noxell Corp. said they received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act regarding the proposed $ 1.4 billion merger of Noxell into P&G . \nShareholders of Noxell , of Hunt Valley , Md. , will vote on the merger at a special meeting on Nov. 30 , the companies said . \nP&G , Cincinnati , agreed to exchange 0.272 share of its common stock for each share of Noxell common and Class B stock , a total of about 11 million P&G shares . \nThe transaction would mark the entry of P&G into cosmetics . \nThe company already markets a wide range of detergents , food , household and health-care products . \nShareholders of Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b . H. postponed their formal endorsement of a merger with Daimler-Benz AG until another meeting on Nov. 17 . \nThe owners of the defense and aerospace concern , which include three regional states , several industrial companies and banks , met Friday to discuss the final terms of the transaction , in which Daimler-Benz will acquire 50.01 % of \nBut agreement aparently could n't be reached because of opposition from the states of Hamburg and Bremen , which are demanding more influence over the German Airbus operations and a better guarantee against job losses in the troubled Northern German region . \nThe two states and the state of Bavaria still hold a majority in MBB , but their stake will fall to around 30 % after Daimler-Benz acquires its stake in the concern . \nJeffrey E. Levin was named vice president and chief economist of this commodity futures and options exchange . \nHe had been associate professor in the department of finance at Seton Hall University . \nSIERRA TUCSON Cos. said it completed its initial public offering of 2.5 million common shares , which raised $ 30 million . \nThe Tucson , Ariz. , operator of addiction-treatment centers said proceeds will be used for expansion , to pay debt and for general corporate purposes . \nOppenheimer & Co. was the lead underwriter . \nThe government issues its first reading on third-quarter real gross national product this week in a report that is expected to disclose much tamer inflation . \nThe consensus view on real GNP , the total value of the nation 's output of goods and services adjusted for inflation , calls for a 2.3 % gain , down from the second quarter 's 2.5 % , according to MMS International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York . \nBut inflation , as measured by the GNP deflator in Thursday 's report , is expected to rise only 3.5 % , down from 4.6 % in the second quarter . \n`` Inflation could be a real surprise , '' said Samuel D. Kahan , chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc. , in Chicago . \n`` If that gets people excited , it could serve as an impetus to the fixed-income markets to lower their rates , '' he added . \nThe week 's other notable indicators include mid-October auto sales , September durable goods orders as well as September personal income , personal consumption and the saving rate . \nMost are expected to fall below previous-month levels . \nMany economists see even slower GNP growth for the remainder of the year , with some leaning more strongly toward a possible recession . \nIn addition to softer production data , weaker housing starts and lower corporate profits currently in evidence , some analysts believe the two recent natural disasters -- Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake -- will carry economic ramifications in the fourth quarter . \nThe recent one-day , 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average seems to be significant to economists mainly for its tacit comment on the poor quality of third-quarter profits now being reported . \n`` The stock market is sick because profits are crumbling , '' says Michael K. Evans , president of Evans Economics Inc. , Washington . \nThe economy , he noted , moves the market , not vice versa . \nOn the other hand , Mr. Evans expects the hurricane and the earthquake `` to take a hunk out of fourth-quarter GNP . '' \nHis estimate of 3.3 % for third-quarter GNP is higher than the consensus largely because he believes current inventories are n't as low as official figures indicate . \nDemand , he believes , is being met from overhang rather than new production . \nBy and large , economists believe the two natural catastrophes will limit economic damage to their regions . \nEdward J. Campbell , economist at Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. , New York , noted that large increases in construction activity along with government and private relief efforts could offset loss of production in those areas . \nGary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\\/Norstar Financial Group , Providence , R.I. , expects the deflator to rise 3.7 % , well below the second quarter 's 4.6 % , partly because of what he believes will be temporarily better price behavior . \nHe expects real GNP growth of only 2.1 % for the quarter , noting a wider trade deficit , slower capital and government spending and the lower inventory figures . \nSung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis , holds that the recent stock-market volatility `` increases the possibility of economic recession and reinforces the bad news '' from recent trade deficit , employment and housing reports . \nThe consensus calls for a 0.5 % increase in September personal income and a 0.3 % gain in consumption . \nIn August , personal income rose 0.4 % and personal consumption increased 0.9 % . \nCharles Lieberman , managing director of financial markets reasearch at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. , New York , said Hurrican Hugo shaved 0.1 % to 0.2 % from personal-income growth , because of greatly diminished rental income from tourism . \nDurable goods orders for September , due out tomorrow , are expected to show a slip of 1 % , compared with August 's 3.9 % increase . \nAs usual , estimates on the fickle report are wide , running from a drop of 3.5 % to a gain of 1.6 % . \nHASTINGS MANUFACTURING Co. declared a regular quarterly dividend of 10 cents a share and an extra dividend of five cents a share on its common stock , payable Dec. 15 to shares of record Nov. 17 . \nThis is the 11th consecutive quarter in which the company has paid shareholders an extra dividend of five cents . \nThe Hastings , Mich. , concern makes piston rings , filters and fuel pumps . \nVickers PLC , a United Kingdom defense and engineering company , said an investment unit controlled by New Zealand financier Ron Brierley raised its stake in the company Friday to 15.02 % from about 14.6 % Thursday and from 13.7 % the previous week . \nI.E.P. Securities Ltd. , a unit of Mr. Brierley 's Hong Kong-based Industrial Equity -LRB- Pacific -RRB- Ltd. , boosted its holdings in Vickers to 38.8 million shares . \nThe latest purchase follows small increases in his holdings made over the past five months . \nIn May , Mr. Brierley 's stake shrank to 8.7 % after ranging between 9 % and 11 % for much of the previous year . \n`` Ron Brierley clearly views our company as a good investment , '' a Vickers spokesman said . \nThe spokesman refused to comment on speculation that Industrial Equity might use its interest as a platform to launch a hostile bid for the company . \nVickers makes tanks for the U.K. army , Rolls Royce cars , and has marine and medical businesses . \nWhen Rune Andersson set out to revive flagging Swedish conglomerate Trelleborg AB in the early 1980s , he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants . \n`` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. Andersson recalls . \nYet under its 45-year-old president , Trelleborg moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- first strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials . \nIt was a gutsy move for a little-known executive , fired after only two months as president of his previous company . \nBut going against the grain has never bothered Mr. Andersson . \nStroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive Swede quips : `` It turned out to be lucky for us . \nIf the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition . '' \nMr. Andersson is anxious to strengthen Trelleborg 's balance sheet . \nCharacteristically , he did n't waste much time getting started . \nOn Tuesday , Trelleborg 's directors announced plans to spin off two big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on Stockholm 's Stock Exchange . \nAt current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed next year would add an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor -LRB- $ 386 million -RRB- to Trelleborg 's coffers , analysts say . \nThe board had also been expected to approve a SKr1.5 billion international offering of new Trelleborg shares . \nBut that share issue -- intended to make Trelleborg better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say . \nTrelleborg 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged SKr29 -LRB- $ 4.48 -RRB- to SKr205 -LRB- $ 31.65 -RRB- in volatile trading Monday in Stockholm . \nTuesday , the shares regained SKr20 , closing at SKr225 . \nMr. Andersson says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down Trelleborg 's share price . \nTrelleborg plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly less than 50 % of both units . \nThe spinoff should solve a problem for the parent . \nA family foundation set up by late founder Henry Dunker controls 59 % of Trelleborg 's voting shares outstanding . \nBut the foundation bylaws require the entire Trelleborg stake to be sold in the open market if control drops below 50 % . \nThat possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance Trelleborg 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding . \nThat growth is the result of Mr. Andersson 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold more than 100 companies during the past five years . \nMost of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers . \nApplying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker AB Electrolux , Mr. Andersson and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results . \nThe treatment turned Trelleborg into one of Scandinavia 's biggest and fastest-growing industrial concerns . \nBetween 1985 and 1988 , sales multipled more than 10 times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold . \nMany analysts expect Mr. Andersson , who owns 1.7 % of the company , to be named Trelleborg 's new chairman when Ernst Herslow steps down next year . \nBut the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. Andersson describes as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas . '' \nLast month , in his boldest move yet , Mr. Andersson and Trelleborg joined forces with Canada 's Noranda Inc. in a joint $ 2 billion hostile takeover of another big Canadian mining concern , Falconbridge Ltd . \nIndustry analysts suggest that the conquest of Falconbridge could vault Trelleborg from a regional Scandinavian success story to a world-class mining concern . \n`` Trelleborg is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as RTZ Corp. or Anglo-American Corp. , '' says Mike Kurtanjek , a mining analyst at James Capel & Co. , London . \n`` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . '' \nBut Trelleborg still must clear some tough hurdles . \nMr. Andersson acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . '' \nBooming metals prices have fueled Trelleborg 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax profit to 68 % this year from a big loss two years earlier . \nBut analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices next year could slow profit growth . \nMining is likely to remain Trelleborg 's main business . \nAnalysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well Trelleborg manages to cooperate with Noranda in the Falconbridge venture . \nNoranda and Trelleborg each came close to winning Falconbridge alone before the successful joint bid . \nSome analysts say Noranda would prefer to break up Falconbridge , and that the Swedes -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like Noranda operating on its home turf . \nMr. Andersson insists that Trelleborg and Noranda have n't discussed a Falconbridge break-up . \nFalconbridge , he says , will continue operating in its current form . \n`` We 'd be reluctant to accept 50-50 ownership in a manufacturing company . \nBut such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' Trelleborg 's president says . \nPerhaps more important , both companies share Mr. Andersson 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries . \n`` If the 1980s were a decade of consumption , the '90s will be the investment decade , '' Mr. Andersson says . \n`` The whole of Europe and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says . \n`` That 's beginning to change . \nAnd investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses Trelleborg is in . \nApple Computer Inc. posted improved fiscal fourth-quarter profit due largely to a $ 48 million gain on the sale of its stock in Adobe Systems Inc . \nExcluding the gain , the company registered a modest 4.6 % increase for the quarter ended Sept. 29 to $ 113 million , or 87 cents a share , from the year-earlier $ 107.9 million , or 84 cents a share . \nProceeds of the Adobe sale brought net income in the quarter to $ 161.1 million , or $ 1.24 a share . \nApple shares fell 75 cents in over-the-counter trading to close at $ 48 a share . \nFiscal fourth-quarter sales grew about 18 % to $ 1.38 billion from $ 1.17 billion a year earlier . \nWithout the Adobe gain , Apple 's full-year operating profit edged up 1.5 % to $ 406 million , or $ 3.16 a share , from $ 400.3 million , or $ 3.08 a share . \nIncluding the Adobe gain , full-year net was $ 454 million , or $ 3.53 a share . \nSales for the year rose nearly 30 % to $ 5.28 billion from $ 4.07 billion a year earlier . \nJohn Sculley , chairman and chief executive officer , credited the Macintosh SE\\/30 and IIcx computers , introduced in the winter , for the brightened sales performance . \nMr. Sculley also indicated that sagging margins , which dogged the company through most of 1989 , began to turn up in the fourth quarter as chip prices eased . \n`` Adverse pressure on gross margins ... has subsided , '' Mr. Sculley said . \nMargins in the fiscal fourth quarter perked up , rising to 51 % from 49.2 % a year earlier . \nFor all of fiscal 1989 , however , the average gross margin was 49 % , below the average 1988 gross margin of 51 % . \nLower component costs -- especially for DRAMs , or dynamic random access memory chips -- were cited for the easing of margin pressure on the company , a spokeswoman said . \nLooking ahead to 1990 , Mr. Sculley predicted `` another year of significant revenue growth , '' along with improved profitability , as the recovery in gross margins continues into 1990 . \nGary J. Schantz , 44 years old , was named president and chief operating officer . \nPolymerix makes lumber-like materials that it describes as `` plastic wood . '' \nThe operating chief 's post is new . \nMartin Schrager , 51 , who had been president , was named vice chairman . \nHe remains chief executive officer . \nMr. Schantz was vice president and chief operating officer of the Acrylic division of Polycast Technology Corp . \nSeparately , the board expanded to six members with the election of David L. Holewinski , a consultant . \nThe company also said it privately placed stock and warrants in exchange for $ 750,000 . \nTerry L. Haines , formerly general manager of Canadian operations , was elected to the new position of vice president , North American sales , of this plastics concern . \nAlso , Larry A.

'' \nAnalysts agree there is little holding sterling firm at the moment other than Mr. Lawson 's promise that rates will be pushed higher if necessary . \nAnd , they warn , any further drop in the government 's popularity could swiftly make this promise sound hollow . \nSterling was already showing some signs of a lack of confidence in Mr. Lawson 's promise Friday . \nIn European trading it declined to $ 1.5890 and 2.9495 marks from $ 1.5940 and 2.9429 marks late Thursday . \nEconomists suggested that if the pound falls much below 2.90 marks , the government will be forced to increase rates to 16 % , both to halt any further decline and ensure that the balance of monetary policy remains unchanged . \nFriday 's Market Activity \nThe dollar posted gains in quiet trading as concerns about equities abated . \nForeign exchange dealers said that the currency market has begun to distance itself from the volatile stock exchange , which has preoccupied the market since Oct. 13 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged more than 190 points . \nCurrency analysts predict that in the coming week the foreign exchange market will shift its focus back to economic fundamentals , keeping a close eye out for any signs of monetary easing by U.S. Federal Reserve . \nLate in the",
